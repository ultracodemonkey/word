All things in the heavens and the earth are working relentlessly to fulfill the Divine Plan. And He is the Almighty, the Wise.
Unto Him belongs the Dominion of the heavens and the earth. His are the Laws of life and death and He has Power over all things.
He has no beginning and He has no ending. He is the Evident in His Attributes and the Hidden in His Person. And He is the Knower of all things. (Time and Space are His creation the totality of which is beyond the grasp of human intellect).
He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six stages, and is established on the Throne of His Almightiness of Supreme Control. (7:54), (10:3), (13:2), (20:5), (25:59), (32:4), (57:4). He knows all that enters the earth and all that comes forth from it, and all that descends from the sky, and all that ascends therein. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah is Seer of what you do.
Unto Him belongs the Kingdom of the Highs and the Lows, and unto Allah return all affairs. (His Laws determine the final outcome of all actions).
He merges the night into the day, and merges the day into the night. He is Knower of all that is in the hearts.
Believe in Allah and His Messenger. And spend of what He has made you trustees (your wealth and persons), on others. Those of you who believe and spend, theirs will be a Great Reward.
And what is amiss with you that keeps you from having conviction in Allah? And the Messenger invites you to believe in your own Sustainer and has indeed taken your pledge, if you are truly believers.
He it is who sends down clear Revelations to His servant, to bring you out from the depths of darkness unto the splendorous Light. And behold, for you Allah is Compassionate, Merciful.
And why should you not spend in the Cause of Allah when to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth? Those who spend and fight before the victory are not at the same level as the rest of you. They have a greater rank than those who spend and fight after the victory. Unto each Allah has promised good. He is Aware of what you do. (55:62), (56:8-12).
Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan that He may increase it manifold, and his may be a generous reward?
On the Day when you will see the believing men and the believing women, their lights shining forth before them, blessing them, (it will be said) "A glad news for you this Day! Gardens beneath which flow rivers, to abide therein. This, this is the Supreme Triumph!" (57:9).
On that Day the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women will say to the believers, "Wait, look on us. Let us borrow from your light!" It will be said, "Go back behind you and seek light." Then a barrier will be put up with a gate therein. On the inner side of it will be Grace, and on the outer side of it the doom.
They will cry unto them, "Were we not with you?" The believers will answer, "Yes, verily - but you let your "Self" succumb to temptation. And you tempted one another, hesitated (watching which side was prevailing), and doubted (Allah's promise). And your fantasies misled you until there issued the Command of Allah. And indeed, the deceiver deceived you concerning Allah. (Deceiver = Desire).
So this Day no ransom can be accepted from you, nor from the open rejecters. Your home is the Fire. That is your care taker and a miserable destination it is.
Is it not time for the believers that their hearts feel humble at the remembrance of Allah and the Truth which has been revealed? Become not like those who were given the Scripture before, and whose hearts were hardened with time. And so, a great many of them have drifted away from Truth.
Know that Allah gives life to the land after it has been dead. For you We have indeed made Our Messages clear so that you might use your intellect.
Behold, the men and women who stand true to their proclamations of belief and lend a goodly loan to Allah, they will be repaid manifold. And theirs will be a generous reward.
For, those who (thus) believe in Allah and His Messengers, it is they - they who are indeed true, and they who are the witnesses to (the Glory of) their Lord. For them is their reward and their light. But, those who openly reject Our Messages and those who deny them in practice - it is they who will be companions of the Insurmountable Barrier (that bars their "Self" from developing).
Know that (in comparison to Eternity) the life of this world is only play and a fleeting delight and décor and your mutual bragging, and pursuit of riches and children. Its example is that of rain - The plantation which it causes to grow, pleases the farmers. But then, it may wither and you can see it turn into yellow hay. And in the end it crumbles into dust! But in the Hereafter it is either grievous suffering or forgiveness from Allah and Approval. Again, the life of this world is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment of illusion. (Therefore, invest in the life to come for lasting rewards).
So, be foremost in seeking absolution of your faults through the Laws of your Lord and thus a Paradise as vast as the heaven and the earth. (It transcends spatial boundaries encompassing the whole Universe (3:133)). It has been readied for those who attain belief in Allah and His Messengers. Such is the Bounty of Allah which He bestows upon him who wills it. And Allah is the Lord of a tremendous bounty.
No disaster befalls the earth, nor yourselves but according to the Laws that We have already recorded in the Book of Decrees. Verily, all this is easy for Allah.
Thus despair not over whatever has left you, nor exult for whatever you have been given. For, Allah does not love any of those self-centered boasters -
- Who withhold wealth and enjoin upon people to hold back resources. And whoever turns away - verily, Allah alone is self-Sufficient, Owner of Praise.
Indeed, We sent Our Messengers with the evident Truth and revealed with them the Law and the Balance of right and wrong that mankind may deal in justice. And We have bestowed the iron in which there is awesome power and many benefits for people, and that Allah may mark out him who helps Him and His Messengers although the victory is initially unseen. Verily, Allah is Strong, Almighty.
And indeed, We sent Noah and Abraham and granted their descendants Prophethood and the Scripture. And among them there is he who goes aright, but a great many of them have drifted away.
Then, in succession, We followed them up with (other of) Our Messengers. We caused them to be followed by Jesus son of Mary and gave him the Gospel. And We placed kindness and compassion in the hearts of those who followed him. As for monastic asceticism - We had never ordained it to them. They invented it themselves to seek Allah's Approval. But then, they did not uphold the Gospel with right observance. And so those who truly believed among them, We gave them their reward. But, a great many of them have been drifting away.
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Be mindful of Allah and put faith in His Messenger. He will grant you double the reward of His Grace, here and there, and appoint for you a light wherein you shall walk, and will absolve your faults. For, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And the People of the Scripture should know that they have no power whatsoever over the Bounty of Allah. All Bounty is in Allah's hand and He grants it according to His Laws. And Allah is the Lord of a tremendous bounty. (He is the Lord of the Worlds and the Lord of all mankind and discriminates not between people (1:1), (114:1)).
