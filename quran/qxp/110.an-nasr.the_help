When comes Allah's Help and the Victory.
And you see the people enter Allah's Religion in throngs. (19:96).
(Think not that your job is done). Then strive hard to make the Divine System a living witness to the Glory and Praise of your Lord. And you shall remain vigilant to guard the System as a helmet guards the head. Behold, He is ever Responsive to your efforts. (94:7-8).
