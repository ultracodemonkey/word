When the hypocrites come to you (O Prophet), they say, "We bear witness that you are indeed Allah's Messenger." Yes, Allah knows that you are truly His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are in fact deniers in practice.
They make their oaths and proclamation of Faith a cover so that they may bar others from the Path of Allah. Miserable indeed is what they do.
This, because they profess (before you) that they have believed whereas afterward (among their folk) they reject the Truth. And so a seal has been set upon their hearts, thus they understand not. (Variation between utterance and action hampers the power of reasoning within human psyche (61:2-5)).
Now when you see them, their looks may impress you. And if they speak, you are inclined to listen to their speech. But they are like wooden logs propped up. (Empty of inner strength unable to stand on their own feet). They think that every call is directed against them. These are the real enemies, so beware of them. Allah condemns them. They are far deviated.
And when it is said to them, "Come! Allah's Messenger will ask for your forgiveness", they shake their heads, and you see them pause, and then draw back in false pride.
It is the same for them whether you pray for their forgiveness, or not pray for their forgiveness. Allah will not forgive them. For, behold, Allah does not guide those who keep drifting away from reason.
They it is who say, "Spend nothing on those with Allah's Messenger, so that they disperse (and leave the city)." However, to Allah belong the Treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites comprehend not. ('Ansar' the Muslim residents of Madinah were supporting the needy 'Muhajirin' or immigrants from Makkah).
And they say (upon returning from Banu Mustaliq in 5 A.H.), "Indeed, when we return to Al-Madinah, we the honored ones will expel there from those contemptible ones." However, all honor belongs to Allah and to His Messenger and those who believe. But the hypocrites know not.
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you from the Reminder of Allah. For, any who does so, it is they, they who are the losers.
And spend on others of what We have provided you with, before death comes to one of you. And he then says, "My Lord! If only You would delay this for a short while, so that I could give in charity and be among the righteous."
But never does Allah delay to a person when his term has come. And Allah is fully Aware of what you have accomplished in life.
