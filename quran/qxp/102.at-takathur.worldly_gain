The relentless greed of material gains distracts you (from the real purpose of life). (57:20), (83:26).
Until you go down to your graves.
Nay! But you will come to know!
Again, Nay! You will come to know.
Nay, only if you could have certain knowledge.
You would see it now, the Insurmountable Barrier (in the way of your personal development (29:54), (79:36), (82:16)).
Finally, you will behold it with sure vision.
And, then, on that Day you will be questioned what you did with the boon of life. (21:13).
