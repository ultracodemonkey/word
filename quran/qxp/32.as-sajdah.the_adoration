A.L.M. Allah Aleem the Knower, Hakeem the Wise, narrates that:
This Book is, beyond any doubt, a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
And yet they assert, "He has invented it." Nay, it is but the Truth from your Lord, for you to warn a folk to whom no Warner has come before you, and so that they might get the Right Guidance. (Prophet Ishmael was the ancestor of, and not a Prophet to, the Arabs who became a community long after he passed on. See note (2:125), (28:46), (36:6). And the Message is to fan out from Arabia to all mankind (2:185), (3:3), (3:137), (6:19), (6:91), (10:2), (14:1), (25:1), (30:58), (39:41), (68:52)).
Allah it is Who has created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six stages, and is established on the Throne of His Almightiness of Supreme Control (7:54). You have no patron and no intercessor beside Him. Will you not, then, bear this in mind?
He governs all that exists, from the celestial Highs to the Lows. And all things evolve higher to what they are meant to be in such stages where a single Day before Him equals a thousand years according to your count. (22:47, 35:10. And some of these stages span fifty thousand years each, of your count 70:4).
Such is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Mighty, the Merciful.
Who created everything in perfect balance. Thus He initiated the creation of man (kind) from hydrated inorganic matter.
Then He made him to be reproduced out of the essence of a humble fluid. (The inorganic matter was hydrated and from its extract life was initiated. Eventually, the evolution reached a point when procreation with male and female gametes was established (37:11)).
(Then Emergent Evolution took place that distinguished humans from the Animal Kingdom.) He shapes him in accordance with what he is meant to be, and breathes into him (something) of His Energy. (This something is a special gift to the humans in the form of free will). And thus (O Mankind) He gives you the faculties of hearing, and sight, and feelings as well as minds. Yet, how seldom are you grateful by making the best use of your perceptual and conceptual faculties!
For, they say, "What! After we have been lost in the earth, shall we indeed be created anew?" Nay, but they deny the Truth that they are destined to meet their Sustainer.
Say, "The angel of death who is assigned for you, will collect you, and then you will be returned to your Lord." (The body dies but the "Self" lives on according to the Law of death).
If only you could see the guilty when they bend low their heads before their Lord, "Our Lord! We have now seen and heard. Return us, then, that we may do good works, for, now we are sure." (33:99-100).
Had We so Willed, We could indeed have imposed Our Guidance upon every human being (like other creatures without free will). But the Word from Me will come true - I will fill Hell with people, rural and urban all together. (A great many people will succumb to their desires (15:39-40), (38:84-85)).
It will be said, "Taste you then, for you remained oblivious of this Day of yours, and so, now We forget you - taste the lasting doom for what you used to do."
Only they truly believe in Our Messages who, when they are reminded of them, fall into complete submission adoring, and strive hard to manifest their Sustainer's Praise. (They establish the Divine System that is the living evidence of how benevolent His Guidance is). And they are never given to false pride.
They forsake their 'comfort zone' in calling people to their Lord, fearing that they have not done enough and hoping to do better. And they keep open for the needy the provision that We have given them. ('Madhaje' = Beds = Present circumstances = Comfort zone).
And no human being can imagine what blissful delights are kept hidden for them as a reward for what they used to do.
Is then, he who was a believer like the one who drifted away from the Divine Values? Nay, these two are not alike.
As for those who attain belief and develop their personalities by fulfilling the needs of others - are Gardens of Resort, as a welcome, for what they did.
But as for those who drifted away from the Truth, their Retreat will be the Fire. As often as they try to come out of it, they will be brought back into it. It will be said to them, "Taste the torment of the Fire that you used to deny."
And verily, We make (the violators of the Divine Law) taste the punishment closer at hand before the Greater punishment, so that they might return to righteousness.
And who does a greater wrong than he who is reminded of his Lord's Messages, then turns away from them? Verily, We shall requite all those who violate human rights by stealing the fruit of others' labor. ('Mujrim' = One who steals the fruit of the toil of others).
And, indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture. So be not in doubt of his receiving it, and We appointed it a Guidance for the Children of Israel. (Therein is a lesson about the outcome of the deniers of Divine Revelation).
We appointed among them leaders who led them by Our Command since they were steadfast in their commitment and had conviction in Our Revelations.
(But later, the Children of Israel divided among themselves and lost their glory.) Verily, your Lord will decide between them on the Resurrection Day, regarding everything they disputed.
Is it not a guidance for them to realize how many generations We annihilated before them - in whose dwelling places they now go to and fro? Verily, in this, behold, are Signs. Will they not, then, listen?
Have they not seen how We lead water onto barren land, and thereby bring forth crops providing food for their cattle and for themselves (20:54)? Have they not the vision?
But they keep saying, "When will that decision be, if you are truthful?" (When will this Message bear fruit?)
Say, "On the Day of Decision (when the rejecters of the Truth will be overwhelmed), pronouncement of belief shall be of no avail to the rejecters then, nor will they be given further respite."
So withdraw from them and wait (for the Truth to unfold). Behold, they too are waiting.
