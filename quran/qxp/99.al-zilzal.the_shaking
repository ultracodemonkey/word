When the earth is shaken with her mighty quaking. (A mighty Revolution will overtake the world).
And the earth yields up her burdens. (Archaeology and mining will make long strides. The heavy tyrants will be thrown out of power).
And mankind cries out, "What has happened to her?" (People will be stunned at the speed of unfolding events).
At that time she will relate her stories. (History of benevolent revolutions will repeat itself on a massive scale).
For your Lord will have sent His Command to her. (Progressive unfolding of the Divine Decree).
On that Day will all people come forth as separate entities, to be shown their deeds. (The guilty will stand apart from the innocent. (36:59)).
Then whoever has done an atom's weight of good, will see it.
And whoever has done an atom's weight of evil, will see it. (The Justice system will improve on earth. And, finally, the Day of Judgment will deliver the Divine Justice).
