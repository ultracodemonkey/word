Verily, (O Prophet) We have opened for you the gates of a Victory that everyone shall behold.
In this way Allah has guarded you against whatever could have caused you to lag behind in the past and in the future. And so, He perfects His Bliss upon you and takes you along a Straight Path. (24:55), (40:55), (47:19).
And thus Allah supports you with a Mighty Support.
He it is Who sends down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers to increase their faith unto the state of conviction. Unto Allah belong all the Forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Knower, Wise. (9:26), (45:22), (53:31).
Thus He will admit the believing men and the believing women into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide. And He will absolve their faults and imperfections. And that is, with Allah, the Supreme Triumph. (11:115).
And He will punish the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the idolater men and idolater women who hold evil assumptions and plans against Allah. Around them is a circle of their disruptive deeds, and Allah's Disapproval is upon them and He deprives them of His Grace. For them He has readied Hell, and how miserable is that as a destination!
Unto Allah belong all Forces in the Highs and the Lows, and Allah is Almighty, Wise. (45:22).
Verily (O Prophet), We have sent you as a witness (to the Truth and to these people) and a herald of glad news and a Warner. (2:143).
So that you mankind may believe in Allah and His Messenger. Therefore, support the Messenger and honor him and do your best to establish the Glory of Allah from morning to evening. (33:41-42).
Behold, all who pledge allegiance to you (O Prophet), in fact pledge allegiance to Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. Hence, whoever shatters his pledge, shatters his own 'Self'. And whoever keeps his pledge with Allah, to him He will grant a Supreme Reward. (9:111).
The Bedouins, who were left behind, will tell you, "Our properties and families kept us occupied, so ask forgiveness for us!" They will utter with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, "Who can avert from you Allah's Law of Requital, whether it is harm or benefit to you?" Nay, but Allah is Aware of all that you do.
Nay, you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never come back to their folk and families. And it was made pleasing in your hearts that you did think evil, for, you are a people devoid of virtue."
As for him who denies Allah and His Messenger - behold, We have prepared a Flame for rejecters of the Truth.
To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives and punishes according to His Law of Requital. And Allah is Absolver of imperfections, Compassionate.
Those who had stayed behind will say - if you go forth to a battle that holds promise of a booty, "Allow us to follow you." They seek to change the Word of Allah. Say, "You shall by no means go with us. This is what Allah has decreed already." Then they will say, "You are envious of us." Nay, but very little it is that they understand (of selfless service). (The battle is no longer to be seen as a means of winning booty, it is allowed only for liberty and self-defense. That is the Word of Allah (8:1), (2:167), (2:193), (60:8-9).
Say to these desert Arabs who had stayed behind, "Soon you will be called against a people mighty in warfare, to fight them until they surrender. And if you obey, Allah will give you a beautiful reward. But if you turn away, as you did turn away before, He will punish you with a painful suffering."
There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the disabled, nor is there blame for the sick. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him in the Gardens underneath which rivers flow. And whoever turns away, him will He punish with an awful doom. (9:91).
Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance unto you (O Messenger) under that shady tree. For, He knew what was in their hearts, and so He sent down upon them inner peace, and rewarded them by opening the gates to a quick Victory. (48:10).
And many gains will they achieve in addition, for, Allah is Almighty, Most Wise.
Allah promises you a great many gains that you shall acquire, and has given you these ones just to begin with. And He has restrained the aggressive hands of people from you, that it may be a Sign for the believers (of all times) and so that He may light up for you a Straight Path. ('Huda' and derivatives = Lead, guide, show the way, enlighten, light up the way, walk ahead, be a beacon).
And there are yet other gains which are beyond your power at this time, but Allah has already encompassed them for you. For, Allah has Power over all things.
Now, if the non-believers fight you, they will certainly turn their backs in flight, and then they will find no protecting friend nor helper.
This is the Law of Allah which has been in force since older times. And never will you find any change in Allah's Law. ('Sunnatillah' = Allah's Law in practice. 'Kalimatillah' = Allah's Word = Allah's Law in theory (3:139), (17:77), (33:38), (33:62), (35:43), (40:85), (48:23)).
And He it is Who has withheld their hands against you, and your hands against them in the Valley of Makkah after He has given you victory over them. And Allah was indeed Watcher over all your actions.
These are the very people who denied the Message, and debarred you from the Sacred Masjid, and prevented your offerings from reaching their destination. Therein were believing men and believing women whom you did not know, and you could have harmed them. And on their account you could have carried guilt without knowing it. Thus Allah admits into His Grace whoever seeks it. Now if the rejecters persist in aggression, We shall indeed clearly separate them (from the believers) and punish them with an awful doom.
Just when the unbelievers had their hearts filled with zeal, the *zeal of the Age of Ignorance, right then Allah sent down His blessing of inner contentment upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and empowered them to ward off this kind of zealotry. For, they truly deserved this virtue and it was befitting for them to own it. And Allah is Knower of all things. (*Zeal for revenge).
Indeed, Allah has vindicated His Messenger's vision of Solidarity. You shall indeed enter the Sacred Masjid, Allah willing, perfectly secure, having unburdened your heads of all fear. And He knows what you know not, and He has granted you a quick Victory.
He it is Who has sent His Messenger with the Enlightenment and the Religion of Truth that He may cause it to prevail over all other systems of life. And Allah is Sufficient as Witness (to this Pronouncement (9:31-33), (14:48), (18:48), (48:28), (61:9)).
Muhammad is Allah's Messenger. And those who are with him are stern towards the rejecters, but full of compassion towards one another. You see them bowing, adoring, as they seek Allah's Bounty and Acceptance. Their signs (of belief) are on their faces, the effects of adoration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel. Like a seed that brings forth its shoot, and then strengthens it, so that it grows thick, and then stands firm on its own stem, delighting those who have sown it. Consequently, it fills the rejecters with rage at them. But unto those who may yet attain belief and do works that help others, Allah promises forgiveness and Immense Reward.
