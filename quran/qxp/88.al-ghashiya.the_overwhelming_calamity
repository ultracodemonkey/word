Has the news of the Dominating Event reached you?
Some faces on that Day will be downcast.
Laboring, exhausted. (They were in motion without action. They toiled without clear direction).
As they enter a sizzling Fire.
Given to drink from a spring of burning anguish.
No food for them but the bitterness of dry thorns (that they scattered to hurt others during their wayward journey through life).
Which nourishes not, nor relieves hunger.
On that Day some faces will shine with Bliss.
Happy with the fruit of their effort.
In a Garden exalted in honor.
Wherein you hear not senseless speech.
Therein is an ever-flowing Spring of Grace (76:16-17).
Therein are thrones of honor.
And shiny glasses set at hand.
And cushions set in rows.
And silken carpets spread out.
Will they not, then, look at:  the water-laden clouds, how they are made? (15:22).
- And at the sky, how it is raised high? (Without visible pillars (13:2)).
- And at the mountains, how they are entrenched?
- And at the earth, how it is spread out? (That you do not even feel the sphere, nor feel its speedy rotations (31:10), (39:5), (79:28-30)).
(This is some evidence, O Messenger!) Remind them, for you are one to remind.
You are not a task master over them.
But whoever turns away and denies the Truth,
Allah will requite him with a great requital.
Behold, unto Us is their return.
Then it is for Us to call them to account.
