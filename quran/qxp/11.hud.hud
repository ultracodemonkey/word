A.L.R. Allah, Aleem the Knower, Raheem the Kind. A Divine Writ this is, the Verses wherein are perfected and then expounded. It comes from One Wise, Aware.
It teaches that you serve none but Allah. (Say O Prophet), "I am unto you from Him a Warner and a bearer of good news.
Seek your Sustainer's forgiveness, then turn towards Him in repentance. He will then grant you a goodly enjoyment of life in this world until a term appointed. He will bestow His abounding Grace on all who abound in merit. But if you turn away, then I fear for you the chastisement of a Great Day."
To Allah is your return and He has Power over all things.
Oh, verily, see how they enshroud their hearts hiding their innermost thoughts, as if to keep Him from knowing them! (Are they trying to live a dual personality? (71:7)) Ah! When they cover themselves with garments of vanity, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. For, He is Knower of the innermost thoughts of the hearts.
There is not a creature in the earth but its sustenance depends on Allah. He is Aware of its habitation and of the needs of His creation at every stage (6:99). He carries them from one station to another until the final destination. His Laws are preserved in the Clear Book of Decree, the Divine Database (55:29).
He created the heavens and the earth in six stages and established Himself on the throne of His Almightiness. He has Supreme Control over the origination of life which began in water (21:30). Life is a test for yourselves to see which of you leads a balanced life and is best in conduct. Yet, if you (O Prophet), say, "You will be raised again after death," the rejecters of the Truth will surely answer, "This is clearly nothing but a fabulous delusion!" (45:24).
And when We delay for them the retribution until after the Period of Respite, they will surely say, "What is keeping back the doom?" Ah! On the day it actually reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them. And their mockery will completely surround them.
(Those who only believe in the instant gains of this life, are quick to rejoice and quick to despair.) If Our Law causes man to taste Mercy from Us and afterward withdraws it from him, he behaves despairing, thankless.
And if Our Law causes him to taste Blessing after some hardship has visited him, he says, "Gone is all affliction from me!" Behold! He falls into exultation and pride.
But those who are steadfast in adversity and prosperity, and work to improve the quality of life for all, behave positively. For them is the protection of forgiveness and a great reward.
Is it then conceivable (O Prophet), that you omit any part of what is being revealed to you (because the rejecters dislike it)? Or because you feel uncomfortable on their saying, "Why has not a treasure been sent down for him, or an angel come with him?" You are but a Warner, and it is Allah Who is the Custodian of all things.
Or they assert, "He has invented it." Say to them, "Then bring a portion of Surahs like this, invented, and call on everyone you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!" (Or produce one Surah like this (2:23), (10:38)).
"And if they answer not your prayer, then know that it has been revealed only in the Knowledge of Allah; and that there is no god but He. Will you then surrender yourselves unto Him?"
Whoever cares for (no more than) the short term gains and glitter of the worldly life, We shall repay for them their deeds herein without the least reduction. (17:18).
But (since they did not invest in the life to come), for them is nothing but Fire in the Hereafter. All that they have contrived here is vain, and worthless is all that they did. (Following ones own desires is the inevitable consequence of disregarding the Divine Values).
Contrary to such people is the one who has truly seen his Lord's Signs in the Universe. Now he has the Prophet as a witness, who correlates Allah's Signs in the Universe with His Messages. And before this, the Scripture of Moses has set a precedent and graceful guidance. (It foretold the advent of the final Messenger; Deuteronomy 18:15-18). Such people will surely attain belief. As for those who league together in rejection of such obvious Truth, the Fire is their appointed place. Harbor not any doubt; verily this is the Truth from your Sustainer. But the majority of mankind do not believe.
Who can be a greater wrongdoer than the one who invents a lie about Allah? (The clergy have always done it with previous Scriptures, and they will do it again (2:79), (3:77), (6:113), (6:138-139), (9:34), (22:52)). Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, "These are they who lied about their Sustainer." Oh, verily, Allah's rejection is the due of all those who displace right with wrong.
They are the ones who hinder people from the Path of Allah, and seek to make it crooked. Thus they practically disbelieve in the life Hereafter.
They cannot escape Allah's Law of Requital even if they run to and fro in the earth, unscathed. Never will they find anyone to protect them from Allah. Double suffering will be imposed on them since they could not bear to hear the Truth nor could see it.
Such are those who have lost their "Self", and all their false imagery, their invented dogmas and idols will leave them in the lurch.
These fabricators will be the worst losers in the Hereafter.
Those who attain belief and work for the betterment of people, and are humble before their Lord, are the rightful dwellers of the Garden; they will abide therein.
These two kinds of people may be likened to the blind and deaf of reason, and the seeing and hearing. Can these two be deemed alike? Will you not then keep this in mind? (13:16-19), (35:39).
We sent Noah to his folk and he declared, "Behold, I come to you with a plain warning."
"That you may serve none but Allah (and follow not the rampant traditions); I am afraid this trend is slowly taking you towards a day of an awful disaster."
But the chiefs of his people, who were the foremost in rejection of the Message, came forward with four objections: We see you but a human being like us. And we see not that any follow you but the obviously lowest caste among us. (17:70). We do not see that you people are in any way superior to us, such as, wealth and property.  Nay, we deem all of you liars.
Noah said, "O My people! Bethink! What if I am taking my stand on clear evidence from my Lord? What if He has blessed me out of His Grace of guidance? It is obscure to you because you are not seeing it through the eyes of reason. In any case, can we compel you to accept what you don't like?"
"O My people! No benefit do I ask you for this. My reward rests with none but Allah. And I am not going to repulse any of the believers (39:40), (63:8). Verily, they know that they are destined to meet their Lord, whereas in you I see people who are wandering in the darkness of ignorance."
"And O My people! Who will help me against Allah if I drove them away? Will you then not reflect?"
"I never say to you that I have the Treasures of Allah. Neither do I claim knowledge of what is beyond human perception, nor do I say that I am an angel. I disagree with you, that my followers are the folk of the lesser status. You claim that Allah will never give them His Bounties, but He knows their true merit. I cannot be unjust to them."
They said, "O Noah! You have disputed with us and disputed a great deal. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are a man of truth."
He answered, "Only Allah brings His Requital according to His Law, once it is upon you, then you can by no means escape."
Noah said, "My counseling and well-wishing will not help you outside of Allah's Law of Guidance and straying (4:88). He is your Lord, and unto Him you must return along with your deeds."
God said to Noah, "Do they say that you have invented this set of values?" "Tell them, if I made it up, I am responsible for my crime. And I am innocent of your crimes." (Let them at least reflect if they are doing wrong or not).
And it was revealed to Noah, "No one of your folk will attain faith except the ones who have believed already. So grieve no longer over their actions."
We commanded Noah, "But build an ark under Our Eyes and according to Our Directions, and do not plead with Me on behalf of the oppressors. (23:27). Behold, they are destined to be drowned." (A flood in the valley of Tigris and Euphrates was forthcoming. (11:44). The rejecters would drown for not following the Prophet).
As he was building the ship, and every time the chiefs of his nation passed by him, they mocked at him. Thereupon he said, "If you are mocking us, behold, we are mocking (at your ignorance) just as you are mocking us."
And soon you will know upon whom a humiliating punishment befalls, and upon whom a lasting torment will come. "
Thus it was until Our Command came to pass. Water gushed forth in torrents over the face of the land. Torrential rain began and the rivers started over flowing. We commanded Noah to take with him livestock, a couple each, and to take his family and followers with him. The rejecters, of course, were not to embark (Noah's son and wife (11:45), (66:10) did not embark). The community of believers with Noah was small.
Noah put his trust in Allah and told his people to embark, "Come on board, in the name of Allah will be its course and its resting. My Lord is the Provider of shelter, Merciful."
The ship sailed with them amidst huge waves as Noah called his son, who was standing aloof, "O My dear son! Come ride with us; do not be with the disbelievers."
He said. "I will cling to a hill-top to protect me from the water." Noah said, "Nothing can protect anyone today from God's Command except for those who have earned His Grace." (The only security that day in the valley was for those who had believed in Noah, followed his advice and thus attained God's Mercy). A towering wave came between them and his son was among those who drowned.
And it was said, "O Earth! Swallow your water and, O Sky! Cease!" And the command was fulfilled. The water sank into the earth. And the ark came to rest upon the Mount Al-Judi. And it was said, "Away with these oppressors of the weak." (The ship came to rest at Judea, in the hills of Ararat, east of the Tigris River).
Noah called upon his Lord, "My Lord! My son was of my family and Your Promise is the True Promise and You are the Most Just of judges." (So, why was he not saved? Didn't You promise to save my family?)
His Lord said, "O Noah! Your son was not of your family. His conduct was not righteous. You were not aware of the Divine Criterion of relationships which are based on Ideology and not on lineage otherwise you wouldn't have asked such a question. I enlighten you so that you don't remain ignorant in this regard."
Noah said, "My Lord! I guard myself in Your shelter from asking favors which do not befit me, and for my lack of knowledge. Forgive me and shower me with Your Grace, otherwise I will become a loser."
He was told, "O Noah! Disembark and descend from the hills in Peace from Us, and there are the blessings of decent sustenance for you and your companions (in spite of the recent flood (11:41)). And other nations, all of them will be awarded according to their deeds. Those who care only for the ornament of this life will be provided for in the world, but eventually suffer from Our Law of Requital." (11:15-16).
(O Prophet) These are the news We reveal to you that neither you, nor your people were aware of. Go ahead with your program with forbearance. The destination of Bliss belongs to those who journey through life upright.
We sent to Aad their brother Hud. He said, "O My people! Serve Allah alone. You have no god but He. As it is, you are but inventors of falsehood."
He said, "O My people! I ask no reward from you. My reward is with Him Who brought me into being. If you use your sense, you will understand."
"O My nation! Come to the forgiveness of your Lord by turning to Him and mending your ways. He will shower upon you heavenly blessings abundant, and add strength to your strength. Do not turn away, guilty!"
They said, "O Hud! You have not shown us any miracle. We will not forsake our idols just because you say so. We are not going to believe you."
"We think that one of our gods has possessed you like a demon and you have gone crazy." Hud said, "I call Allah to witness, and you too bear witness that I am absolutely free of your idolatry."
"Get together, all of you and your gods besides Him. Make a firm decision against me and give me no respite."
"I have put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is not a creature in the Universe beyond His firm Control. Behold, my Lord is on the Straight Path."
"You may accept or reject the Message that I have clearly conveyed to you. If you turn away, you will decline and fall. Then, My Lord will bring another nation in your place. You cannot harm Him at all. Verily, My Lord is He Who is the Guardian of all things."
And so, when Our Command came to pass, We saved Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. We saved them from a harsh retribution that inflicted the rejecters.
Such were Aad. They denied the clear Messages of their Lord, rebelled against His Messengers and followed the command of every stubborn tyrant.
And they were pursued in this world by Divine rejection, and will be overtaken by it on the Resurrection Day. Oh, verily, Aad denied their Sustainer! Oh, away with the Aad, the people of Hud!
And to the nation of Thamud, We sent their brother Saleh. He said, "O My people! Serve Allah. You have no one worthy of obedience but He. He initiated you from the earth and made you thrive thereon. Come to His forgiveness, then turn to Him in repentance mending your ways. My Lord is ever-Near, Responsive."
They said, "O Saleh! Great hopes We had placed in you before this! But now you are telling us to move away from worshiping what our forefathers worshiped. Verily, now we are in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion about the meaning of your call to us."
He said, "O My people! Do you really think? If I have clear evidence of the Truth from my Lord, and there has come to me a mercy from Him, who can help me against Allah if I disobey Him? (If I get intimidated), you can only push me into ruin.
(The feudal lords had been depriving the poor of using the land and its natural resources of water and vegetation.) Saleh said, "O My people! This she-camel belonging to Allah shall be a token for you. So leave her alone to graze in the land belonging to Allah. Do her no harm, lest speedy punishment befall you (91:13)." (This verse along with (55:10) pronounces one of the most revolutionary concepts of the Qur'an. The land, the earth is owned by none but Allah and must be open for all His creation as a means of sustenance. Hence, all landlord-ship is contrary to the Divine Ordinance. In the Divine System, the Central Authority will see to it that any piece of land will be for those who toil in it and give Allah His Right, the poor-due (6:141)).
But they cruelly slaughtered her. Thereupon He said to his people, "Only for three more days shall you enjoy life in your homes. This is a Promise not to be belied."
And so, when Our Command came to pass, by Our grace We saved Saleh and the believers with him from the humiliating annihilation of the day. Verily, your Lord, He alone is Strong, Almighty.
(Saleh and His followers moved out of the town while the disbelievers stayed back with their mockery.) And a tremendous blast overtook the oppressors, and then they lay lifeless, in their very homes, on the ground.
As if they had never lived there. Oh, verily, Thamud had denied their Lord. Oh, away with the Thamud!
(Similar was the outcome of the people of Lot.) Our Messengers came to Abraham bearing a glad tiding. They greeted Abraham with "Peace!" And he greeted them back with "Peace!" and made haste to place before them a roasted calf.
But when he saw that their hands did not reach out towards it, he deemed their conduct strange and became apprehensive of them. But they said, "Fear not! Behold, we are sent to the people of Lot." (Abraham was apprehensive thinking the visitors refusing hospitality might have aggressive intentions, but in fact they were hurrying to Lot).
And his wife (Sarah), standing nearby, laughed when We gave her good tiding of Isaac, and after Isaac, (his son) Jacob.
She exclaimed, "Oh, woe is me! Shall I bear a child, now that I am an old woman and this husband of mine is an old man? This is really strange!"
Answered the Messengers, "Do you wonder about Allah's Command? May Allah's Grace and Blessings be upon you, O dwellers of the house! Verily the Owner of all Praise, Sublime is He!"
When the fear had left Abraham, and the good news was conveyed to him, he began to plead with Us for Lot's people.
For, Abraham was clement, kind-hearted, ever turning to His Lord.
(It was said) O Abraham! Forsake this! Your Lord's Command has gone forth, and verily, the retribution is now inevitable.
When Our Messengers came to Lot he was distressed, and knew not how to save his people. He exclaimed, "This is a difficult day!"
And the most iniquitous among his people came rushing to Lot. (They wished the visiting Messengers to approve their behavior). Lot said, "O My people! Your wives, who are like my daughters, are permitted for you. Be mindful of Allah's Laws, and do not humiliate me in the presence of my guests. Is there not a single upright man among you?" (Genesis 19:14 states that Lot offered them his own married daughters. Two daughters and the whole crowd! Nay, a Prophet is the spiritual father of his nation).
They said, "You know, we have little interest in our wives whom you call your daughters. And, you know well what we want." (Our intention is to get our behavior into the realm of the Permissible).
Lot exclaimed, "I wish I had the strength to resist you or had some strong support among you."
The visiting Messengers said, "O Lot! Behold, we are Messengers of your Lord. Never shall they follow your guidance nor shall be able to catch up to you. Depart then, with your household and followers, while it is yet night. Leave this land never to look back again. Except your wife for, what befalls the people will befall her as well. Their appointed time is the morning, and isn't the morning near? (She stays behind because she has chosen to go along with the trends of the times. And she is among those who remain silent at the prevalent wrongdoing).
And so, when Our Command came to pass, We brought low the highly arrogant towns (Sodom and Gomorrah), and rained down upon them hard devastating rocks (from the volcano).
The stones were marked arrows from your Lord. His Requital is never far from those who displace the right conduct with wrong.
And to Midyan, We sent their brother Shoaib. He said, "O My people! Serve Allah alone. There is no god for you but He. And give not short measure and weight. I see that you are well-to-do, but (any system based on injustice is never durable) I fear for you a Day that will surround you with chastisement."
"Hence, O My people! Always give full measure and weight with equity and do not deprive people of what is rightfully theirs. Do not spread corruption and disorder in the land."
"That which Allah gives you as just profit is better for you if you believe. But I am not a guardian over you."
They said, "O Shoaib! (We had thought that your religion was only a matter between you and your Lord). Does your Salat command that we should forsake the worship that our fathers practiced? Or, that we leave off doing what we like to do with our economy? Behold, you want us to think that you are the only clement, and the rightly guided man among us."
He said, "O My people! Think again! What if I have clear evidence of the Truth from my Lord? What if He has provided me with a decent and honorable sustenance while I follow His Laws? I deal in all fairness and I shall never preach what I don't practice behind your sight. I sincerely desire your betterment so far as I can. But the achievement of my aim depends on Allah alone. I trust in Allah and turn to Him hoping for the best."
"O My people! Let not my disagreement with you be taken personally to cause you to persist in your guilt so that the same (retribution) befall you that befell the people of Noah, and the people of Hud, and the people of Saleh. And remember that the people of Lot did not live very far from you."
(None of the nations was destroyed for a deficiency in their worship. They met destruction for violating human rights). "Seek forgiveness of your Lord, then repent by journeying on the right path. You will experience that my Lord is Merciful, Loving."
They said, "O Shoaib! Much of what you tell us is beyond our comprehension. We see that you are not a man in power in our midst. If we were not concerned about your family and your tribe, we would have stoned you. You are of no value to us."
He said, "O My people! Is my family and tribe more honorable to you than Allah? You only take His name as a formality. In real life you assign the back seat to Him. Remember, my Lord surrounds all your actions."
"O My people! Act what is in your power and I will work. Soon you will know upon whom comes a humiliating doom, and who is a liar. And watch! I am a watcher with you."
When Our Command came to pass, We saved Shoaib, and those who believed with him, by a mercy from Us. An awful blast seized the wrongdoers. The morning found them dead in their very homes, on the ground. (Shoaib and his companions had moved to safety as forewarned).
As if they had never lived there. Oh, away with Midyan, just as the Thamud have been done away with!
And, indeed, We sent Moses with Our Messages and a manifest authority.
To Pharaoh and his chiefs. They followed only the command of Pharaoh, and his command did not lead to right.
Pharaoh will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection, and lead them into the Fire. What a miserable place to land! (14:28).
Divine rejection was made to follow them in this world and will overcome them on the Day of Resurrection. Contemptible is the gift that will be given to them.
(O Messenger), this is news from only a few of the past communities that We narrate to you. Some of them are merely surviving and some have vanished.
We did no injustice to them, but they wronged themselves. And when the Command of your Lord came to pass, their gods whom they called besides Allah availed them not. They only added to their ruin.
Such is the grasp of your Lord's Law of Requital on townships when they run oppressive systems. His grasp is painful, strong.
Herein, verily is a lesson for those who fear the suffering of the life to come. That is a Day unto which all mankind will be gathered, and that is a Day that will be witnessed by all that ever lived. And the results of all actions will become manifest.
And We defer the Day only to a specified time.
On the Day, when it comes, no one will speak except by His Leave. Some of them will be miserable, others glad. (The miserable ones will get deprived of the blessings, and the glad ones will enjoy all the bounties of the eternal life (36:59)).
Now those who by their deeds brought misery on themselves will be in the Fire; sighing and wailing will be their portion. (21:100).
Therein to abide, as long as the New Universe endures; that is time beyond count, unless your Lord decrees otherwise. Your Lord is Doer of what He Wills in the World of Command. (The current Universe will be dismantled for a new Universe (5:44), (14:48), (21:104), (25:22), (39:37), (69:16), (70:9).
The happy ones on that Day will enter the Garden and live there as long as the New Universe endures, that is time beyond count; until your Lord opens for them the way to further evolution, a gift unfailing.
Be not in doubt about the outcome of those who worship idols in any form. They only blindly follow their forefathers. They and their forefathers will get their due portion according to Our Law of Requital.
People differed even when Moses was given the Scripture. Had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the case would have been judged between them. (The Word that the Final Revelation, the Qur'an, will come forth with the Plain Truth.) They are still lingering on in their doubts about the Messages of their Lord.
Unto each your Lord will verily repay his works. He is fully Aware of what they do.
Therefore, (O Prophet) stand firm as you are commanded, along with those who turn to Allah with you. Remember to be moderate in all your actions. He is watching all that you do.
Do not be intimidated by the oppressors and guard yourself against even a touch of the Fire. Remember, there are no protectors to help you against the Laws of Allah. And then you will not be helped in any way.
Strive to establish and consolidate the Divine System, day and night. Actions that create balance in the society remove the ill effects of inequities. Good deeds remove bad deeds. This is a reminder for those who pay attention.
Be steadfast in service. Allah never loses the wages of the benefactors of humanity.
(Here is a lesson for the future of humanity.) Alas, among the older generations there were few people of virtue, those who would take a stand against corruption and disorder in the land. Except the few whom We saved for their righteousness. Whereas most people indulged in violation of human rights, enjoying the fleeting delights of the world and thriving on the fruit of others' toil.
For, your Lord would never annihilate a community for wrong beliefs alone as long as its people behave righteously towards one another. (The Qur'an is consistent in its theme that people will be rewarded according to what they do YA'AMALOON, and not what they know YA'ALAMOON. The reason that the Book stresses so much on the right belief system, is that humans are strongly influenced in their behavior by what they think and believe).
Had your Lord so willed, He could have made all mankind one single community, (but He has granted them free will as against other creatures (5:48)). Therefore, they continue to hold divergent views. Eventually however, the Divine Truth given in the Qur'an will be the dominant force in the world bringing most of the mankind together (9:33), (41:53), (48:28), (61:9).
Your Lord will have Mercy on those who work toward that Noble Objective. He created them from one common source. The smaller and the bigger communities that defy Divine Laws will fulfill the Word of your Lord, "Verily, I shall fill Hell with the rural and urban mankind all together."
And (O Messenger), all that We relate to you of the history of some Messengers, is in order to strengthen your heart. Although through these accounts the Truth comes to you, but it is also meant to be an enlightenment and Reminder for all believers in this Divine Writ.
And tell those who adamantly disbelieve, "Do anything that may be in your power, while, behold, we shall labor in God's Way."
And tell them, "And wait for what is coming. Behold, we are also waiting."
And Allah alone comprehends the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth. For, all that exists goes back to Him as its Source. Serve Him, then, and place your trust in Him alone. Your Lord is not unaware of what you humans do.
