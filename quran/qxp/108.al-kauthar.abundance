Behold, We have bestowed upon you Abundant Good. (The ever flowing stream of Wisdom and Knowledge in this Qur'an (13:35), (14:24-25)).
Therefore, follow the Commands of your Lord and convey them to others so that they might follow as well. And sacrifice your comfort for the welfare of the community. ('Sall' = Follow closely. 'Nahr' = Sacrifice = Sacrificing a camel = Sacrificing one's own comfort and resources for a noble cause).
Verily, it is your opponent that will be cutting himself off from the Abundant Good.
