O You (Prophet) the great selector of companions, the best caravan leader!
Stay vigilant even by night, and never fall short on it -
- Half an effort or less than perfect.
Or, you shall increase it whenever warranted. And convey the Qur'an in a calm distinctive manner, stage by stage.
Behold, We are charging you with a substantial Declaration (a Lofty Mission).
Verily, the vigil of the night impresses the minds most strongly, and the speech is most upright. (Mutual consultation with your companions is more effectively done at night).
Behold, by day you are engaged in continued strife.
Keep eminent the Name of your Lord and detach yourself from needless pursuits for His sake.
Lord of the East and the West! There is no god but He. Hence, hold on to Him as Dispenser of affairs.
And endure with patience whatever people may say, and leave them with a noble leaving.
And leave the deniers of the Truth unto Me - these 'masters of luxury'. And you give them some time.
Behold, with Us are shackles and a blazing Fire.
And a choking food and an awful doom.
The Day is coming when the masses and the wealthy tyrants will shake, and the leaders will become heaps of sand.
Behold, We have sent unto you a Messenger to be a witness concerning you, just as We had sent unto Pharaoh a Messenger.
But Pharaoh rebelled against the Messenger, whereupon We seized him with a calamitous seizing.
So, how, if you keep rejecting, will you guard yourselves on a Day which will turn children gray. (A Day of horrifying events).
The very sky will then be rent asunder. (The arrogant leaders will be scattered). His Promise always come to pass.
Behold, this Qur'an is a Reminder, a Giver of eminence. Now, whoever wills' let him set out on a Way to his Lord.
Behold, (O Messenger!) Your Lord is fully Aware (that you are dedicated to your Mission). There are nights when you stay up working two thirds, one half, or one third of the night as do your companions. But Allah has designed night and day. You and your companions cannot over-work indefinitely. So He turns to you in kindness. (He does not ordain for you hardship). Inculcate, then, as much of the Qur'anic teachings in their hearts as you may do with ease. He knows that among you are sick people, and others have to earn their living and travel for it. And those who have to fight in the Cause of Allah. Recite and convey the Qur'an, then, at ease. And establish the Divine System and set up the Just Economic Order. And lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for your 'Selves' you will find with Allah, better and more excellent in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Behold, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
