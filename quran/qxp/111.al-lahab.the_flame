Perished is the power of Abi Lahab, and perished is he!
His wealth and gains will avail him not! (69:27-28), (92:11), (96:7).
He shall have to endure a fire blazing, glowing.
And his wife, that carrier of slanderous tales, the firewood hauler.
Will have her neck ornamented with a rope of palm-fiber. ((17:13). 'Jeed' = A neck decorated with an ornament).
