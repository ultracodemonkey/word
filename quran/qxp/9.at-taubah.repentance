(O You who have attained belief! The treaties that you had signed with the idolaters of the Arabian Peninsula, no longer remain valid, for they have repeatedly violated them (9:4)). Freedom from obligation in this matter is proclaimed from Allah and His Messenger towards those Idolaters with whom you made a treaty.
(O Idolaters who have repeatedly violated the peace treaties), Travel freely in the land four months, and know that you cannot escape Allah, and that Allah will bring disgrace to the rejecters of the Truth. (If you persist in rebellion, you will be overpowered and the Central Authority will subdue you).
And a proclamation from Allah and His Messenger is herewith made to all mankind on this day of the Greatest Pilgrimage (9th day of the 12th lunar month, Zil-Hajjah). Allah disowns the idolaters, and so does His Messenger. So, if you repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away from repentance, then know that you cannot escape Allah. (O Messenger) Give tiding of an awful retribution to those who are bent upon denying the Truth.
Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty and they have not subsequently failed you, nor have they helped others against you. You shall fulfill your treaty with them till their term. Verily, Allah loves those who are mindful of His Laws.
When the four Sacred Months are over and if the idolaters are still aggressing, neither becoming law-abiding citizens of the State, nor emigrating, subdue them wherever you find them, take them captive, and besiege them, and ambush them. But if they repent from aggression, and help in the consolidation of the Divine System and in setting up the Just Economic Order of Zakat, then leave them free. Verily, Allah is Forgiving Merciful.
(O Messenger) If anyone of the idolaters seeks your protection or a safe passage, grant him protection from the State. Convey to him the Word of God, and then send him to a place where he feels safe and secure. This kindness on your part is mandatory because they are people who have not yet seen the beauty of the Divine System.
How can there be a treaty with Allah and His Messenger for the idolaters (when they have repeatedly violated it)? Exempted are those with whom you make a treaty at the Sacred Masjid. If they honor and uphold such a treaty, so shall you. Allah loves those who walk aright.
How can there be a treaty seeing that if they get the upper hand of you, they would respect no ties and no pacts with you? They pleased you with their speech but their hearts opposed you. Most of them are those who slip away from their word.
They trade away Allah's Revelations for petty gains and hinder people from His Path. Their deeds spread inequity and confusion in the society. (This trade mentioned in the Qur'an, generally indicates disregarding Divine Moral Values in favor of instant gratification achieved by following the selfish desire).
They respect no tie and no pact regarding a believer. They are the ones given to excesses.
If they mend their ways, and as law-abiding citizens, help consolidate the Divine System, and the Just Economic Order of Zakat, then they are your brothers in the System of life. We explain Our Revelations for those who wish to learn. (The usual translation of this verse conveys the meaning that if they start praying five times a day and give 2.5% poor-due per year, then they are your brothers in religion. This interpretation goes directly against the all-encompassing Ordinance of Allah that there is no compulsion or coercion in DEEN Islam (2:256)).
If they keep breaking their pledges after their treaty, and assail your System, then fight the chiefs of the disbelievers. They have no respect for their binding oaths. This action will help restrain them from aggression.
Will you not fight a folk who keep breaking their solemn pledges and did everything to drive out the Messenger, and did attack you first? What! Do you fear them? Nay, it is Allah alone Whom you should more justly fear, if you are truly believers.
Fight them! Allah will punish them at your hands, and He will humiliate them, and give you victory over them, and He will soothe the bosoms of those who believe. (Soothe from the persecution they have undergone for more than a decade).
He will remove the anger and frustration the believers have suffered at their hands. The invitation is still open to the opponents. Allah, according to His Law, turns to those who turn to Him. He is All Knowing, All Wise.
Do you think that you will be left alone without Allah distinguishing those among you who strive in His cause, and take none for ally except Allah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah is Informed of all your actions.
Those who associate others with Allah whether idols, religious leaders or temporal leaders, shall not administer Masjids, the Centers of the Divine System. Nor shall those who choose for themselves sects in religion (9:107), (30:31), (72:18). They are bearing witness against themselves in their disbelief (of the Qur'an). All their works are vain and they will abide eternally in the Fire.
Only those people are fit to administer the Masjids, the Centers of the Divine Order, who have unwavering belief in Allah and the Last Day. And, they strive to establish the Divine System, and to set up the Just Economic System of Zakat and fear none but Allah. They are the only ones who are rightly guided.
Do you think that providing water to Pilgrims and caring for the Sacred Masjid (in Makkah) is equal to the work of him who has Conviction in Allah and the Last Day and then strives in the Cause of Allah? They are not equal in the Sight of Allah. Allah does not intervene to guide those who displace action with ritual.
Those who attained belief, and left their homes, and strove in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives, have a much greater rank with Allah. They are the ones who are truly triumphant.
Their Lord gives them good news of His Grace, His Approval, and the Gardens with lasting delight and bliss.
They will live there forever. Verily, with Allah is immense Reward.
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Even if your parents and siblings take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith, take not them as allies. Whoever does that, does wrong to himself. (The Divine Ideology shall take precedence over all other bonds).
Say, "If your parents, your children, and your siblings, and your spouses, and your tribe, and the wealth you have acquired, and the business in which you fear a decline, and the houses you love, are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His Cause, then wait till Allah brings His Command to pass." (Systems based on other than the Supreme Divine Ideology are destined to collapse). Allah does not intervene to guide those who drift away from Divine Laws.
Allah has given you victory on many fields. But in the Battle of Hunain, you took pride in your numbers but it did not avail you. And the vast earth was made narrow for you, then, you began turning away in flight.
Then Allah sent His peace of reassurance down upon His Messenger and upon the believers (48:4). And sent down armies you could not see, and punished the rejecters. (The Messenger led them from chaos back to discipline, and boosted their morale. That was the army unseen (3:125), (8:10), (9:40), (41:30)). Such is the reward of the rejecters of the Truth.
Allah will turn in Mercy to the worthy according to His Laws. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! The idolaters have made their hearts unclean (and the Sacred Masjid of Makkah is the House of Pure Monotheism. Only those who believe in the Divine System can administer this Sacred House (9:18)). So let not the Idolaters come close to it after this year. If you fear scarcity of trade, Allah will enrich you with His Bounty. This is the Promise of Allah who is Knower, Wise.
Fight against those who reject belief in Allah and the Last Day, and hold not Sacred what Allah and His Messenger have declared Sacred, nor acknowledge the Divine System, among those who received the Scripture, until they pay JIZYA, the tax, with willing submission, and feel themselves subjects of the State as law-abiding citizens. (As citizens of the State they must pay taxes, as the Muslims contribute toward the Just Economic Order of Zakat. In return, the State will guarantee them internal and external security, and equal rights of citizenship. JIZYA will always be less than Zakat, and will be payable only by the able-bodied Non-Muslim citizens of the State. In addition, these able-bodied citizens would be exempt from compulsory military service).
The Jews say, "Uzayr is God's son," while the Christians say, "The Messiah is God's son." They only utter baseless themes with their mouths, following in spirit assertions made in earlier times by people (like the Greeks and Zoroastrians) who denied the Truth! Allah condemns them. They are surely deluded. (Some Jews in the Arabian Peninsula used to believe that Osiris, the Egyptian idol, was God's son while others thought of Ezra, who restored the Torah after it had been lost in the Babylonian Exile, as God's son).
They take their rabbis, priests and monks to be their Lords* besides Allah. And they take as their Lord, the Messiah son of Mary. Yet they were commanded to worship but One God. There is no god but He. Praise and Glory to Him, He is far too Glorious for what they ascribe to Him. (*Talmud shows the Jewish superstition of ascribing divinity to Ezra, rabbis, saints, doctors of law and learned men. And the doctrine of Papal infallibility, divinity of saints and praying to them are common in the Roman Catholic Church).
They seek to extinguish Allah's Light (the Qur'an) by their utterances (61:8). But Allah will not allow this to pass, for He has Willed to spread His Light in all its fullness even though the rejecters may detest it.
He it is Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the True Religion (DEEN = The System of Life), that He may cause it to prevail over all religions and systems of life, even though the idolaters may detest it. (9:31-33), (14:48), (18:48), (48:28), (61:9).
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! A great many religious leaders, rabbis, priests, monks, mullahs, yogis, and mystics devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood, and debar them from the Path of Allah. All those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the Cause of Allah, to them give tidings (O Prophet) of a painful doom.
On the Day when it will all be heated in the fire of Hell and their foreheads, flanks and backs will be branded with it. "Here is what you hoarded for yourselves, now taste what you had hoarded."
Allah has ordained twelve months in one year. This has been Allah's Ordinance since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Four of these Months are Sacred, forbidden for all warfare. (Mankind, through international treaties, must agree to shun all kind of warfare during these four months. This will give them a cooling off period that sense may prevail over emotions). This is the Firm Religion, the right way. So, do not wrong yourselves by fighting during the Sacred Months. However, you may fight the idolaters in any or all these months if they fight against you in any or all of them (2:194). And know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves. (Four Sacred Months: (2:194), (9:1-5)).
Altering the Sacred Months is only an addition to disbelief. It increases the straying of the disbelievers. They keep the total count of the Sacred Months as four, but keep shifting them within the same year or from year to year. Thus they allow what Allah has forbidden. Their evil actions seem pleasing to them. Allah does not intervene to guide those who have decided to live in darkness.
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! What is amiss with you that, when called upon, "Go forth in the Cause of Allah," you cling heavily to the ground? Do you choose pleasure in the life of this world rather than in the life to come? The enjoyment of this life is but a paltry thing compared to the Hereafter.
If you did not go forth in Allah's Cause, His Law will afflict you with a painful doom. He will replace you with another nation. You cannot harm Him in the least. All things transpire according to the Laws appointed by Allah. (Only the competent nations live honorably in the earth (21:105), (24:55)).
If you do not help the Messenger, Allah will help him, as always. When the disbelievers drove him out of his home, they were just two men. They had to seek refuge in a cave. The Messenger said to his companion, "Grieve not. Surely, Allah is with us." Then Allah sent His reassuring peace upon him, and supported him with invisible forces of faith and courage (9:26). He made the word of the disbelievers utterly low. Allah's Word remains Supreme, for Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Go forth lightly armed, or heavily armed and strive with your wealth and person in the Cause of Allah. This is best for you if you but knew.
There are people among you that if it were a quick material gain and a short easy journey, they would follow you. But the strife and the distance seem heavy and long to them. They will swear by Allah, "If we could, we would have gone along with you." They destroy their "Self". Allah knows that they are liars.
Allah pardons you (O Messenger)! Why did you give them permission to stay behind, before you could distinguish the truthful from the liars? (The granting of permission gave the hypocrites an excuse).
Those who have conviction in Allah and the Last Day, do not ask you for exemption from striving with their wealth and persons. And Allah is Aware of those who walk aright.
Only those ask your leave (O Prophet) who do not truly believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their hearts feel doubt, and in their doubt they waver.
If they wanted to go forth, they would have made necessary preparation. Allah disliked their participation for their reluctance, and held them back. (The Prophet's permission had) said to them, "Stay behind with those who are sitting back."
Even if they had gone forth they would have only caused trouble and run to and fro seeking sedition among you. In your ranks are some apt to listen to them and in your ranks are spies of the enemy. Allah knows the wrongdoers.
They have sought to create dissension among you before, and raised difficulties for you (O Prophet). They did that till the Truth came and the Decree of Allah prevailed, though they detested it.
Of them is he who says, "Grant me leave, and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already? In fact, Hell is all around the disbelievers.
If some good comes to you (O Prophet) it afflicts them. And if calamity befalls you, they say, "We took our precautions beforehand." And they turn away rejoicing.
Say, "No calamity befalls us humans except within the bounds of Allah's Laws. Only He is our Lord Supreme (Maulana)." In Allah let the believers put their trust!
Say, "Can you expect for us other than one of the two things" (victory or martyrdom in the Cause of Allah?) On the other hand, we expect for you retribution from Allah's Law of Requital, and it may be at our hands when you fight against us. Wait then hopefully, and we shall hopefully wait with you."
(Some hypocrites want to make financial contributions.) Tell them, "Your contribution is not accepted whether you pay willingly or unwillingly. You are a people who drift away from the System at the first opportune time."
What prevents their contributions from being accepted is this: They do not truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. They only claim to believe (2:8). They join you in congregations of prayer only half-heartedly and just to be seen of men (4:142), (107:5). And they contribute only with great reluctance in their hearts. (Islam involves only willing submission to Allah (2:256).
Let not their riches nor their children and party astonish you (O Prophet). It holds them back from the way of struggle. According to Allah's Law there is no Paradise for those who fail to strive and build it with their own hands (3:135), (16:32), (46:14-16). They live the life of hell in this world and they depart this world in sorrow for their rejection (9:85).
And they swear by Allah that they are of you. In fact, they are not of you, but they are people ridden with fear.
If they could find a refuge or a cave or a hiding place, they would rush to it like runaway horses.
Some of them try to find fault with you (O Prophet) in the distribution of charity. If they are given plenty, they are pleased and if they receive little share, they get enraged.
It would have been enormously good for them if they were content with what Allah and His Messenger had given them (59:7). And if they said, "Allah suffices us. (What we have received in equity is good for us). Allah will give us of His Bounty, and the Messenger will distribute in kindness and equity. We turn to Allah with all our hopes." (The Central Authority will be just to all).
Remember that the funds that the Central Authority receives as Alms and Charity belong to the following categories: The poor. Those who are not able to earn enough living to meet their basic needs, for any reason.  Those whose running businesses have stalled or the ones who have lost their jobs, who have become needy with their active lives coming to a standstill. Officers who have been appointed by the government to collect alms and charity. Those who are hindered from joining the Divine System for financial reasons. To free men and women from bondage of any kind: physical slavery, unjust captivity, and oppression from any quarters. Those pressed under the load of ransom or heavy debt from an enemy. Defense of the Ideological State, in the Cause of Allah. The wayfarer who becomes needy, or travels to the believers in destitute condition, and the homeless son of the street. This is a Duty from Allah. He is the Knower, the Wise and His Commands are based on Knowledge and Wisdom.
And among those (enemies of the Truth) are some who hurt the Prophet and say, " He is only a hearer." Say, "A listener, that is good for you. He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." Those who vex and hurt the Messenger of Allah, for them is an awful punishment. (The Messenger is not an emperor or a king who keep guards around them. He is accessible to all at all time and it is good for you that he pays attention to everyone).
(O You who believe) People swear by Allah to you in order to please you (and improve personal relations). But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger, if they really believe (and embrace the Divine Ideology).
Don't they know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, for him verily is Hellfire, to abide therein? That is the supreme disgrace.
The hypocrites fear that a Surah might be revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say, "Go on mocking! Allah will bring to light exactly what you are dreading."
And if you ask them (O Messenger), they will say, "We only talk and jest." Say, "Do you realize that you are mocking Allah, His Revelations and His Messenger?"
"Make no excuse. You have disbelieved after your confession of belief." If We forgive a group of you, there is another group whom We shall punish since they have violated human rights by stealing the fruit of others' labor." (Unless they restore their rights (4:17), (9:102), (25:70), (27:11)).
The hypocrites, both men and women, are all of a kind. They enjoin the doing of what is wrong and forbid the doing of what is right, and withhold their hands from doing good. They are oblivious of Allah, and so He is oblivious of them. (Whoever forgets Allah, forgets himself and his honored stature of being a human (59:19)). Verily, the hypocrites drift away from humanity.
Allah promises the hypocrites, both men and women, and the rejecters of the Truth, the fire of Hell for their abode. It suffices them. They deprive themselves of the Grace of Allah, and theirs is the lasting torment.
There have been people like you before who were mightier than you in strength, more affluent than you in wealth and children and party. They enjoyed their share of this worldly life. And you have been enjoying your share, just as they did, and you indulge in idle talk as they did. Such are the people whose works have perished in the world and in the life to come. And it is they, yes, they who are the losers.
Has not the history reached them of those before them? Of the People of Noah, Aad, Thamud, Abraham's folk, the dwellers of Midyan, and the disasters that befell them. Their Messengers had come to them with clear evidence of the Truth. Allah never did injustice to them. But they used to wrong their own people and thus wronged their own "Self".
And the believers, both men and women, are colleagues one of another. They enjoin the doing of Right and forbid the doing of Wrong (The distinction between right and wrong will never be arbitrary. The Qur'an is the eternal Criterion of what is right and what is wrong (2:185)). Together, they help establish the Divine System, and set up the Just Economic Order of Zakat (9:60). This is how they obey Allah and His Messenger. These are the men and women on whom Allah will shower His Mercy. Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Allah promises to the believers, both men and women, Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will live forever, and magnificent dwellings in the Gardens of Eden. And Allah's Approval is the greatest of all Blessings. That is the Supreme Triumph.
O Prophet! (Establishment of the Divine System will build a paradise on earth. But you will meet staunch opposition). Strive hard against the rejecters of the Truth and the hypocrites! And be tough with them without the least inclination towards compromise in matters of Ideology. Their ultimate abode is Hell, a miserable destination indeed.
(The hypocrites) swear by Allah that they have said nothing wrong. Yet they most certainly have uttered a word of disbelief (9:61-62). And have denied the Truth after professing their surrender to Allah. They were aiming at something beyond their reach (attaining inner peace without sincerity to the Divine Guidance). And they could find no fault in the Divine System except that Allah has enriched them and caused His Messenger to enrich them out of His Bounty. Hence, it will be good for them if they repent and correct themselves. But if they still turn away, Allah will cause them to suffer grievous retribution in this world and in the life to come. And they will have no protector or helper in the earth.
And among them are those who promise Allah, "If He gives us of His Bounty we will certainly spend in charity and will certainly become of the righteous, the ones who help others."
Yet, when He gave them His Bounty they hoarded it and turned away from their promise.
Allah's Law instilled hypocrisy in their hearts till the Day they meet Him (until their demise). This is because they broke their word to Allah that they promised Him, and because they lied again and again.
Do they not know that Allah knows their thoughts and secret consultations and that Allah is the Great Knower of Things Hidden?
It is these hypocrites who find fault with such of the believers who give generously, and they find fault with such believers who have nothing to give but the fruit of their toil and labor. They ridicule them all. Allah's Law of Requital will cause their ridicule to rebound on themselves, and grievous suffering awaits them.
(O Prophet! You very compassionately ask forgiveness for them.) It does not matter if you ask forgiveness for them, or not, Allah will not forgive them even if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness. They have rejected Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not intervene to guide people who intentionally drift away from the Right Path.
Those (hypocrites) who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the Messenger of Allah, and disliked to strive with their wealth and persons in Allah's Cause. They said, "Let us not go forth in heat." Say, "The fire of Hell is more intense", if they but understood. (And the aggressors could soon bring the heat of the conflict to their homes).
Then let them laugh a little, they will weep much, as the reward of what they have earned.
If Allah returns you to a situation where they ask your permission to go forth, say, "You shall never again go out with me for any foe. For you were well pleased with sitting still the first time. Stay at home then with those who are obliged to remain behind (women, children, elderly men, the sick and the disabled).
Nor shall you (O Prophet) ever follow the funeral of any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave. They rejected Allah and His Messenger and drifted away from the Divine Commands till death.
Let not their wealth nor their children or party astonish you! Allah's Law will punish them with these things and their "Self" will depart while they are disbelievers (9:55). (Hoarding of wealth and taking pride in children, party and possession causes the humans to ignore the Divine Laws in their daily lives, thus these things become a tribulation for them (2:195), (8:28), (18:32), (63:9), (68:14), (57:20)).
When a Surah is revealed saying, "Attain belief in Allah, and strive along with His Messenger", the able-bodied men of wealth ask your leave and say, "Allow us to stay behind with those who remain at home."
They are well pleased to be with the disabled, the elderly, the women and children, and the ill. This attitude puts a seal on their hearts. They seldom understand (that fear can only be overcome with action (2:277), (6:48), (6:81)).
And the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive with their wealth and person. For them are all the good things and high ranks, and they are the ones who are truly prosperous.
Allah has made ready for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide. That is the Signal Victory.
And of the wandering Arabs also, there were some who made excuses and came to claim exemption. And those who were false to Allah and His Messenger, merely sat behind. Grievous suffering is bound to befall the unbelievers among them.
Not to be blamed are the physically weak, the elderly, the sick, and the ones who have no means to offer, so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger (48:17). They should keep doing what they can to support the Cause. There is no way of blame against the doers of such good. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Nor is there any blame on those who came to you (O Messenger), requesting that you provide them with mounts (horses and camels). You told them, "I cannot find a ride to mount you on." They returned with eyes flowing with tears out of sorrow that they had no means to spend for equipment.
The way of blame is only against those who ask for your leave when they are rich and able-bodied. They are well pleased to be with those who are obliged to stay behind. They have caused Allah's Law of Requital to seal their hearts without knowing it.
They will make excuse to you when you believers return. Say, "Make no excuse, for we shall not believe you. Allah has informed us about you. Allah and His Messenger, the Central Authority, will keep you under probation. And then you will be brought back to Him, the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will make you truly understand what you were doing in life."
They will swear by Allah, when you return to them, so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone (9:125). They have blotted their humanity and earned the abode of Hell with their actions.
They swear that you believers may be pleased with them. Even if you accept them, Allah does not accept those who drift away from His Commands (9:23-24).
The desert Arabs are more hard in rejection and hypocrisy, and more likely to ignore the Limits that Allah has revealed to His Messenger. Allah is Knower, Wise.
Among these Bedouin Arabs is he who looks upon his spending as a penalty, and awaits a disaster to hit you. (They hope for the Divine Order to collapse). It is they who invite disaster upon themselves. Allah is Hearer, Knower.
And among the Bedouins are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and consider their spending as a means towards Allah and a means of supporting the Messenger. This will raise their ranks with Allah. Allah will embrace them with His Mercy. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Gracious.
And the first to lead the way are the emigrants (from Makkah), their hosts who sheltered them (in Madinah), and those who followed them in goodness, Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. He has made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. This is the Supreme Triumph.
Some of the Bedouins who dwell around your town are hypocrites, and some of the people of Al-Madinah also persist in hypocrisy. You know them not, We know them. We will punish them twice (they will be humiliated in the battle and they will see their families and children embracing Belief). Then they will be relegated to a painful doom.
There are others who acknowledge their faults. Since they have a mixed record of good and bad deeds, they may hope that Allah will relent towards them, for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Accept their contribution for the community. Purify their thoughts with proper education and training so that their "Self" may grow. Help them! Your support is a great source of peace in their hearts. Allah is Hearer, Knower. (Let the believers adopt the Divine qualities in their human capacity).
Do they not know that Allah is He Who accepts the repentance of His servants, and accepts their charity? Verily, Allah is the Acceptor of repentance, Merciful.
Say, "Act! (Prove your word with action). Allah will behold your actions, and so will His Messenger, and the believers. Ultimately you will be returned to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible. He will show you a replay of all you used to do."
There are some who await Allah's Decree whether He will punish them or relent to them. Allah is All Knowing, All Wise. (Their matter is under investigation by the State. Allah's Laws are based on Knowledge and Wisdom (9:118)).
(The hypocrites keep making schemes.) They built a Masjid out of mischief and to promote disbelief, and sectarianism among the believers, and as an outpost for those who warred against Allah and His Messenger before. They will surely swear, "We had but good intentions", but Allah bears witness that they are liars.
You shall not stand in such a Masjid! (6:160). There is a Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on the Secure Way, it is more worthy that you stand therein. In it are men who love to be purified, and Allah loves those who keep clean of division and sectarianism.
Is he who founded his building on the Secure Way of Allah and His goodly Acceptance better, or he who founded his building on the crumbling cliff of "Shirk" that topples down with him into the fire of Hell? Allah does not intervene to guide a folk who displace right with wrong.
The building which they have built will never cease to be a misgiving in their hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces. (A building that divides believers will remain a source of unrest in the hearts of the sectarians till their hearts stop beating). Allah is Knower, Wise.
Allah has bought from the believers their persons and their goods, for (in return) theirs is the Garden. They shall fight in the Cause of Allah, and shall slay and be slain. It is a Promise that is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel, and the Qur'an. Who can fulfill a promise better than Allah? Rejoice then in the bargain you have made, for that is the Supreme Triumph. (Deuteronomy 6:4-5, 6:32. Matthew 10:5, 10:39, 19:29, 21:19).
Triumphant are those who: Return to the Right Path and take corrective action as soon as they feel that they have erred. Obey the Commands of Allah. Praise Allah in word and action by serving His creation. Pick up lessons from travel and from history. Are always humble before the Divine System. Adore Allah alone. Promote the Qur'anic Values, and resist the non-Qur'anic customs. Guard against trespassing the Limits ordained by Allah. These are the men and women who deserve a pleasant life in both worlds (33:35), (66:5). Give them the glad tiding (O Messenger).
It is of no avail for the Prophet and the believers to ask forgiveness when the idolaters face the Law, even if they are their relatives, once it has been made clear that they are destined for Hell.
Abraham asked forgiveness for his father because of a promise that he had made. The promise was based on the hope that his father would mend his ways. When Abraham was sure that his father was a persistent opponent of Allah's Commands, he desisted from asking forgiveness for him (14:41), (19:47). Abraham was kind-hearted, clement.
Allah never sends a folk astray after He has guided them, unless they violate the Laws that were made plain. Surely, Allah is the Knower of all things.
To Allah belongs the Dominion of the heavens and the earth. He has full control over the Laws of life and death, for individuals and nations. You have no protector and helper outside Allah's Laws.
Allah is Kind to the Prophet, the emigrants and those who hosted them. The support came in difficult times. That is when the hearts of some of them slightly wavered. Allah turned to them in Mercy. He is Compassionate and Kind to them.
Allah showed compassion to the three men who had stayed behind. They felt hopeless and the vast earth seemed shrunk to them, and their lives became narrow for them. They realized that there is no refuge but within the Divine Laws. Then He turned to them in Mercy that they too might turn in hopeful repentance (9:106). Allah is Acceptor of repentance, Merciful.
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Be mindful of Allah's Laws and be with the truthful. (That is way to Paradise (89:29)).
People of Madinah, and the Bedouins around, should not stay behind the Messenger. Nor shall they prefer their lives to his life. For, any thirst, effort or hunger that afflicts them in the Cause of Allah, or a single step that they take that angers the rejecters, and whatever gain they gain from the enemy, becomes a credit, a good deed recorded for them. Allah never loses the wages of the doers of good.
And whatever they spend, small or large, and whenever they cross a valley, it is recorded in their credit, so that Allah repays them the best return for their actions.
The believers shall not all go to an expedition. Of every group of believers, let some of them come forth to gain sound knowledge of DEEN (the Qur'anic System of life). Then they can pass the knowledge on to their people when they return, so that they may remain aware.
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Fight those of the disbelievers who close up on you, and let them find strength among your ranks. And know that Allah is with those who are mindful of His Laws.
Whenever a Surah is revealed some of them (hypocrites) say, "Which one of you has increased in faith?" In fact, it has increased the believers in faith and they rejoice.
But those who have caused their hearts to ail by harboring doubts, it only adds another element of disbelief to disbelief, and they die refusing to accept the Truth.
Don't they see that they are tested once or twice each year (at your hands 9:14)? Still they do not repent, nor pay heed.
When a Surah is revealed, the hypocrites look at each other mockingly as if saying, "Does anyone see you? Let us leave." And then they turn away. Allah's Law turns their hearts away because they are a people who do not use their faculties of understanding.
(All humanity must realize that) there has come to you a Messenger one of your own who feels your burden. He is full of concern for your betterment, and for those who attain belief, he is compassionate, merciful.
(O Messenger) if they turn away, say, "Allah suffices me. There is no god, but He. In Him I put my trust. He is the Lord of the Tremendous Throne."
