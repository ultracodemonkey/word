O Mankind! Be mindful of your Sustainer so that you may journey through life in blissful honor and security. (If you failed to bring the house of humanity to order), the Hour will quake the earth with awesome wars.
On the Day when you behold it (wars of such intensity that) even a nursing mother would forget her infant, and the pregnant would abort her fetus. And it will seem to you that all mankind is drunk, although they will not be drunk. But the Divine Requital is a tremendous thing.
And yet, among people are those who argue about Allah without attaining knowledge, and follow every rebellious satanic force.
For the rebellious desire it has been decreed that whoever befriends it, verily, it will mislead him and guide him to the retribution of the Flame.
O Mankind! If you are in doubt that humanity will one day stand at its feet, and that you will be resurrected back to life after death, consider the process of your own evolution. We have created you in stages: From dust, then from male and female gametes, then from a zygote, then from an embryo, shapely and first shapeless. We thus clearly explain things for you. The embryo and then the fetus stay in the womb until an appointed term according to Our Laws. Then We bring you forth as infants and carry you to maturity. While some of you die young, others live to the feeblest old age so that they know nothing after knowing much. (Resurgence of humanity can take place just as) you, O Prophet, see a dry barren land, but when We send down water on it, it vibrates with life and grows all kinds of beautiful plants.
All this happens because Allah alone is the Ultimate Truth and He alone revives the dead and because He has Supreme Control over all things and events.
And know that the Hour is bound to come, beyond any doubt, and that Allah will indeed resurrect all who are in their graves. (And He will raise humanity onto their feet, just as He will raise the dead from their state of disintegration whether in graves or in the oceans, in ashes, their scattered pieces sprayed about, or in the bellies of the fish and the birds).
And yet, among people are those who argue about Allah without attaining knowledge, guidance and without any light-giving Revelation. (22:3).
Turning away in pride to divert people from the Path of Allah. Disgrace is in store for them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will make them taste the doom of burning.
Saying, "This is what you sent before with your own hands, for Allah is no oppressor of His servants.
And among people there is the one who serves Allah conditionally. If things go his way, he is content. But if some adversity touches him he turns on his face. (4:143). Thus he loses both, in this life and the life to come. That is the sheer loss.
He calls on, instead of Allah, that which neither can harm him nor benefit him. This is indeed the utmost one can go astray.
He calls unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefits; verily, an evil master, and an evil follower.
Verily, Allah will admit those who have attained belief and fulfill the needs of others, into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. This is Allah's Intention, and so shall it be done.
If anyone thinks that Allah cannot help him in this world and in the life to come, let him reach out unto the heaven by any other means and thus try to make headway. And then let him see whether his approach will dispel the cause of his anguish.
And thus We have revealed the Qur'an in simple and plain verses. Allah Guides him who seeks Guidance.
And verily, as for those who have attained faith in this Divine Revelation, and those who follow the Jewish faith, and the agnostics, and the Christians, and the Zoroastrians and the idolaters, verily, Allah will decide between them when the Ultimate Truth will become manifest to them as humanity rises to its feet, and finally on the Day of Resurrection. Behold, Allah is Witness over all things and events. (2:136), (11:121), (22:55-56).
Don't you see that all things and beings in the heavens and in the earth, the sun and the moon, and the stars and the mountains, and the trees, and the animals, and a great many human beings pay adoration to Allah? And there are a great many human beings who make themselves worthy of Requital. And those whom the Divine Law shall disgrace, none can raise them to honor. For, Allah carries out all actions according to His Laws.
There are two contrary kinds of man who contend about their Sustainer. Those who are bent upon denying the Truth will have garments of flames they cut out for themselves, and burning despair will they cause to be poured on their top priorities. (104:6-7).
Causing all their inner arsenal and their exterior proclamations to melt away to naught.
Time is coming to restrain the criminals in rods and chains. (21:39), (57:25).
Whenever, in their anguish, they try to come out of it, they shall be returned to it, "Taste the doom of burning."
Whereas, behold, Allah will admit those who have attained belief and helped others, into the Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. Therein (like royals) they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and where silk will be their garment. (18:31).
For they were willing to be guided towards the best concepts and the best ways of expression. Thus they were guided onto the path that leads to the Praised One. (QAUL includes concept and expression).
Verily, those who reject the Truth and bar people from the Path of Allah, and from the Center of Divine Ideology, the Sacred Masjid, must know that We have appointed it for all mankind alike. This is the Inviolable House of worship and security for the locals as well as the visitors (2:125). Whoever seeks to relegate it from Ideology to ritualism, directly or through side cannels, We will make him taste an awful doom. (Zulm = Relegation from the rightful place).
Behold! We pointed the site of the Sacred House (Ka'bah) to Abraham, saying, "Associate none with Me, and keep My House clean of human dogmas for those whose Divine Ideology of Monotheism will revolve around this Center for all mankind. Train the visitors to stand up for Truth, and bow to and prostrate before Divine Commands." (2:125), (2:197), (3:95-97), (22:28-29).
"And announce to mankind the duty of Pilgrimage. They will come to you on foot, and on every kind of fast mount, coming from every far-away point on earth."
So that they might see with their own eyes and experience what benefits the Divine System holds for them (in addition to uniting them in the common bond of humanity). And they shall commemorate Allah's Name collectively during the specified days of Hajj; and over the livestock He has bestowed upon them. Then host one another with the livestock (to make the Congregation self-sufficient in the food resource). Eat and feed the distressed poor (regardless of whether they are in the congregation or elsewhere).
As they host one another, they shall consult to clean out their societies of individual and collective vices. And, design ways to fulfill their obligations as human beings. Then they shall walk around the Ancient House in their resolve.
All this is the purpose of Hajj. Whoever will honor these Directives and Limitations, it will be well for him in the Sight of his Lord. The livestock here is lawful food for you except for those already prohibited (2:173), (5:3), (6:145), (16:115). You shall avoid idol worship in any form, and abstain from bearing false witness. Avoid all things that bring your progress to a standstill. Lying, bearing false witness and flamboyant behavior are specifically forbidden at this congregation to prevent nullification of the grand objective (Rijs, Awthan, Zoor encompass all the stated meanings).
Turn to Allah alone, associating none with Him. For whoever ascribes partners to Allah, it is as if he has fallen from the sky and the birds snatch him or the wind blows him to far-off places.
Such is his state. And anyone who honors the symbols set up by Allah must know that mere honoring these symbols is of no value without righteousness of the heart.
(The livestock during Hajj are a symbol of devotion to God.) In them are benefits for you. They carry you and your loads and their only place for sacrifice or donation is this Ancient House.
And to every community We have ordained rites that they might extol the Name of Allah over the sustenance He gave them from the livestock. But your God is the One and Only God. Therefore, submit to Him alone (22:67). And give glad news to all those who are humble.
The truly humble are those whose hearts tremble with awe whenever Allah is mentioned (8:2). And they steadfastly bear whatever ill befalls them. And they constantly strive to establish and consolidate the Divine System and spend the wealth that We have given them, on their fellow human beings.
And the camels! We have appointed them among the symbols (of obedience) to Allah; in them is much good for you. (They carry you and your loads and then help you host one another). So mention Allah's Name over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). And after they have fallen to the ground lifeless, eat from their flesh, and feed the contented poor who beg not as well as the poor who ask. Remember that Allah has subjected these animals to you so that you may be practically grateful.
Neither their meat nor their blood reaches Allah. What reaches Him is your sincere devotion. He has thus subjected them to you that you manifestly establish the Greatness of Allah in the land for everyone to behold (the objective of Hajj). And to see how magnificent the Guidance is that He has bestowed upon you (2:185). And (O Prophet) give glad news to all benefactors of humanity.
Verily, Allah will defend the community of true believers. Behold, Allah does not love those who betray the Divine System ordained in this Book and thus show ingratitude for the magnificent Guidance they have received. (Hence, His Promise to defend will not apply to such people).
Permission to fight is granted to those against whom war is wrongfully waged. And Allah is indeed Most Powerful for their aid.
Those who have been evicted from their homes unjustly, for no reason other than saying, "Our Lord is Allah!" For, if Allah had not enabled people to defend themselves against one another, monasteries, and churches, and synagogues, and masjids, where the Name of Allah is oft mentioned, would surely have been destroyed. And Allah will certainly help those who help Him. For, Allah is Mighty, Powerful.
Those who, if We give them power in the land, establish Salat - the Divine System - set up the Just Economic Order of Zakat (in which wealth circulates freely to nourish every member of the society, and the basic needs of all individuals are taken care of). Their rule ensures that the Divine Moral Values are promoted, and what the Qur'an forbids, is discouraged. And in their governance all affairs are decided according to Allah's decrees (in the Qur'an (5:44)).
(This is the framework of the Constitution that would finally take effect.) If they deny you (O Prophet), so did, before them, the people of Noah, Aad, and Thamud.
As did the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot.
And the dwellers of Midyan. And Moses was also denied (by Egyptians). And I gave the rejecters a period of respite, but then I took them to task. And how awesome was My rejection of them!
And how many a township have We (Our Law of Requital) annihilated, for they oppressed people and violated human rights! And now they lie deserted, with their roofs caved in! And how many a well lies abandoned, and how many a castle in ruins that once stood high!
Have they never journeyed about the earth, letting their hearts gain wisdom, and causing their ears to hear? Indeed, it is not their eyes that become blind, but blind become their hearts that are in the breasts.
And so (O Prophet) they challenge you to hasten the doom, but Allah never fails to fulfill His Promise. A day of your Lord is like a thousand of your years. (32:5), (70:40). (Before your Lord, is the eternal Now. He is Above temporal and spatial bounds).
("As you sow, so shall you reap", is a rock-solid Law, as evidenced by the history of the rise and fall of nations.) How many communities have gone before whom I gave respite although they were transgressors, but then My Law of Requital seized them. For with Me is the end of all journeys.
Say, "O Mankind! I am but a plain Warner to you."
And know that communities who attain belief and augment the human potential, shall be granted the protection of forgiveness and a most excellent provision (in both worlds).
Whereas those who strive against Our Messages seeking to defeat their purpose, they are destined to face the Insurmountable Barrier.
Yet whenever We sent any Messenger or Prophet before you, satanic people tried to confound the central aims of the Message in his very life-time. But Allah rendered null and void all the aspirations they had. And Allah makes His Messages clear in and by themselves, for Allah is All Knowing, Wise. (Satanic people then tried to alter his teachings after he passed on. Allah, then, sent another Messenger to restore the purity of His Messages (6:113). Until the Final Message was revealed and Allah Himself guaranteed its preservation.)
(Allah allows) these satanic people to advance their aspirations so that He might make this conspiracy a test for people and distinguish (the true believers in the Divine Revelation) from those who have a disease in their hearts. Verily, those who relegate the Divine Revelation in favor of human aspirations create great schism and sectarianism. (Zulm = Relegation from the rightful place). (2:53).
Those who are blessed with true knowledge, will recognize your Lord's Truth, accept it, and then settle it in their hearts and humbly submit to Him. Surely, Allah alone is the Guide of those who truly believe, to the Straight Path. (5:48), (15:19).
And those who disbelieve in the Divine Word (by failing to sort out the human aspirations), will remain in suspense until the Hour befalls them suddenly, or there comes to them the doom of a disastrous day.
On that Day all Dominion will visibly belong to Allah, and His Law and His Judgment will prevail in the human society as well (through this Divine writ). Then those who believe in this Divine Revelation and contribute to the advancement of the society, will be in the Gardens of Delight, in this world and in the Hereafter.
Whereas for those who are bent upon denying the Truth and belie Our Messages, there shall be a humiliating suffering in store.
And as for those who forsake the domain of evil in the Cause of Allah and are then slain or die, Allah will most certainly provide them a goodly sustenance. For, verily, Allah, He alone is the Best of providers.
Allah, the Knower, the Clement, will admit them to a place they will love.
Thus shall it be. As for him who responds to aggression only to the extent of the attack that was leveled against him, and is then again treacherously attacked, Allah will certainly help him. For Allah is Mild, Forgiving. (22:39).
This is because just as Allah merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night, (likewise, there are Divine Laws for fluctuation of people's fortunes) - And because Allah is Hearer, Seer.
Thus it is - Allah! He is the Ultimate Truth. That on whom they call instead of Him is sheer Falsehood, and because Allah, He alone is the High, the Great.
Have you not seen how Allah sends down water from the sky and then the earth becomes green? Verily, Allah is Unfathomable, Aware.
Unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And, verily, Allah is the Self-Sufficient Absolute, the Owner of Praise.
Have you not realized how Allah has made everything in the earth subservient to you? And the ships run upon the sea by His Command, and He holds back the celestial bodies and high atmosphere from coming down on to the earth except in accordance with His Law. Verily, Allah is Compassionate, Merciful to people.
And He it is Who gives you the gift of life, then He will cause you to die, and will then give you life again. Yet, ungrateful is man (not using the gift of life to its maximum potential).
We have let every community hold some rites that they observe (as a diversity of humanity (49:13)). So, let them not involve you in their arguments, just call them to your Lord (2:177). For, behold, you (O Prophet) are indeed on the Right Way.
And if they argue with you, say, "Allah is best Aware of what you do."
Allah will judge among you regarding all your differences when humanity stands up to its feet, and finally on the Day of Resurrection. (2:213), (22:17), (22:56).
Do you not know that Allah is fully Aware of all that is in the High and the Low? All that, behold, is in the Divine Database. Verily, all this is easy for Allah.
And yet, they (who, seeing His Dominion of the Universe, claim to believe in Him, often) idolize instead of Allah that wherein He has placed no power, and they know nothing about them. (They blindly follow their ancestors' ways (10:39). There is no helper for those who relegate the reality to conjecture.
And when Our Messages are conveyed to them in all clarity, you can notice a denial in the faces of those who are bent upon rejecting the Truth. They would almost attack those who convey Our Messages to them. Say, "Shall I, then, tell you something worse than what you feel now? The Fire! Allah has promised it for those who are bent upon denying the Truth. How miserable a journey's end!"
"O Mankind! Here is an example for you to listen and ponder! Behold, those beings you invoke instead of Allah, cannot create as much as a fly, even if they were to join all their forces to do so. And if a fly robs them of anything, they cannot get it back from it. Weak indeed is the seeker and weak indeed the sought."
They esteem not Allah as He must be esteemed. In fact, Allah is the One, Mighty, All Powerful. (6:92), (39:67).
(In His Almightiness) Allah chooses Message-bearers from among the angels as well as from among mankind. Behold, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
He knows all that is of the past, the present and the future. For, to Allah all things return (and go back to Him as their Source).
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and serve your Lord. And do good for the community so that you may achieve a blissful prosperity.
Strive hard in Allah's Cause, with all the striving that is due to Him. It is He Who has elected you to carry the Message and has placed no hardship in religion, the creed of your father Abraham (2:143), (2:288). It is He Who has named you Muslims in the bygone days and now in this Revelation. That the Messenger may be a witness for you, and you be witnesses for all mankind! (You shall be the watchers over peoples that no community oppresses the other). So, establish the Divine System and set up the Just Economic Order, and hold fast unto Allah. He is your Lord Supreme, and how excellent is this Giver of support!
