All things in the heavens and all things in the earth strive to manifest the Glory of Allah, the King Supreme, the Impeccable, the Almighty, the Wise.
He it is Who has sent a Messenger among those who had never before received a Scripture - to convey unto them His Messages, and to make them grow in humanity, and to instruct them in the Scripture (as it is being revealed) and Wisdom, Judgment and establishment of Allah's Rule on earth. Whereas before that they were obviously lost in error.
And (sent for) others who have not yet joined them in place and time. For, He is Almighty, the Wise.
Such is Allah's Bounty - which He bestows upon him who is willing to receive it. (His Light is available to whoever turns it on). For, Allah is the Lord of Great Bounty.
(The Book of Allah is to be read and understood, and not placed in high niches.) The example of those who were entrusted with Torah, and did not apply it in their daily lives, is that of the donkey that carries a load of books. Tough indeed is the example of people who deny Allah's Verses by their actions. Allah does not show the Way to people who displace the Revelation from its rightful station. ('Kizb' = Belie = Give lie = Deny in practice. 'Kufr' = Reject openly = Darkness = Denial = Ingratitude. 'Zulm' = Dislodge from the rightful place = Relegate the Truth = Give preference to other sources = Oppression = Wrongdoing = Violation of human rights).
Say, "O' You who follow the Jewish faith! If you claim that you are friends of Allah to the exclusion of the rest of mankind, then long for death if you are truthful!"
But never will they long for it because of the deeds their hands have sent ahead. And Allah is fully Aware of those who relegate the Truth. (2:94-96).
Say, "Behold, the death from which you shrink so much is bound to overtake you, and then you will be returned to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible. And then He will inform you of what you truly accomplished."
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When the prayer is announced on the Day of the Congregation, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave your commerce. That is for your own good if you use your knowledge to understand.
And when the prayer is ended, disperse freely in the land and seek of Allah's Bounty. And remember Allah often so that you may prosper.
Yet when they see some bargain or entertainment, they rush to it, and leave you standing. Say, "That which is with Allah is better than all entertainment and all bargain. And Allah is the Best of providers."
