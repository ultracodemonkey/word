Say, "I seek refuge with the Lord of the Rising Dawn.
From the evil aspects of created things.
And from the evils of the darkness of Ignorance whenever and wherever it is encountered.
And from the covert activities of people who try to put knots and complicate the simple.
And from the evil of the envious when he envies (and tries to harm)."
