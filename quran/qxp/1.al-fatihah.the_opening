With the Glorious Name of Allah, the Instant and Sustaining Source of all Mercy and Kindness.
All Praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer of the Worlds. (The marvels and the profound harmony in the Universe are the living witness that its Creator, Sustainer is truly worthy of all Praise).
He is the Instant and Sustaining Source of all Mercy and Kindness (as He showers His Bounties on all creation indiscriminately and without return).
He is the Absolute Owner of the Day when all creation shall have completed their journey of existence, evolution and action to the Ultimate Just outcome. And He is the Supreme Law-Giver to humans to enable them to live by the System of Life that He has ordained. People will be ultimately judged according to how well they tried to live by His Laws.
(Realizing these facts), we affirm to obey Your Commands only and ask You to help us as we do that.
Guide us to the Straight Path (by providing us with faculties that listen more than hear, observe more than see and analyze more than process).
This has always been the Way of those whom You rewarded.  And not the path of those who had to face Your Requital (for blind following and arrogance), and not the path of those who faltered and deviated from the Straight Path.
