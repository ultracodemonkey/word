Behold, We have revealed it in the Night of Majesty.
Ah, what will enlighten you what it is, the Night of Majesty!
The Night of Majesty is better than a thousand months. (A day of enlightenment is better than a life-time of ignorance).
The Universal forces and the Divine Revelation have descended therein, by their Lord's Leave and shall work in concert with every Decree to carry out His plan.
Peace! It is a Message of Peace, and inevitably shall dawn a new Morning of Enlightenment (39:69).
