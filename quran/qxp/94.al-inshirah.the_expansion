Did We not expand your chest? (Endowed you with resilience, understanding and a heart and mind to accomplish the ‘impossible’).
And thus lightened your burden. (Made the journey through life easy by bestowing upon you the perceptual and intellectual faculties). (80:20).
Which would weigh on your back so heavily.
And exalted your renown (O Prophet!). (And gave eminence to you, O Mankind!).
And behold, with every hardship comes ease.
Indeed, with every hardship comes ease!
Hence, whenever you are free from the immediate task, embark upon the next strife.
And turn all your attention to your Lord. (Remain focused on the Mission entrusted upon you by your Lord).
