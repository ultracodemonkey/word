Say, "O You who deny the Truth, and, thus, by remaining ungrateful to the Creator's Ultimate Guidance, choose to live in darkness!
I do not worship that which you worship. (Neither your idols, nor your tenets, nor your moral values, way of life, nor your holy men or leaders).
Nor do you worship that which I worship.
And I will never worship that which you have ever worshiped.
Nor (unless you see the Light) will you worship that which I worship.
Unto you your way, and unto me my Way."
