The Catastrophe!
What is the Catastrophe?
Ah, What will convey to you what it is, the Catastrophe!
The Day when people will be like moths scattered in confusion.
And the mountains will be like flakes of wool.
And then, he whose scales are heavy (with good deeds),
Will live in happiness and contentment.
But as of him whose scales are light,
He will be embraced by an Abyss.
Ah, what will convey to you what that is!
Raging Fire!
