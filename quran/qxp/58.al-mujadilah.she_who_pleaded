Allah has indeed heard her who pleads with you (O Prophet) concerning her husband, and complains unto Allah. And Allah has heard your mutual dialogue. Verily, Allah is Hearer, Seer.
Those of you who make senseless declarations about their wives, they by no means become their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. And so, behold, they only utter what is contrary to reason, and thus, false. And behold, Allah is Absolver of faults, Forgiving. (The procedure of divorce has been clearly expounded in (2:228-230), (4:3), (4:19), (4:35), (4:128), (33:4), (65:1-2)).
Hence, those of you who have made senseless declarations about their wives, and then put them away into separation, and then wish to go back on their utterance - they should free a human being from bondage before the couple may 'touch' each other. This you are hereby admonished to perform. And Allah is Aware of all you do. (Freeing from bondage includes relieving someone from any kind of oppression and from a crushing burden of debt).
However, he who does not have the means thereof, let him resort to Abstinence (as in the month of Ramadan) for two consecutive months before the couple may 'touch' each other. And if he is unable to do that either, he should arrange the feeding of sixty needy ones. This is so that you might be true to your faith in Allah and His Messenger. Now these are the bounds ordained by Allah. And for the deniers of the Divine Commands is a painful doom.
Verily, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be disgraced as were disgraced those before their times. Thus, We have sent down Clear Messages, and for the rejecters is a shameful suffering.
On the Day when Allah will raise all of them together, He will inform them of what they truly accomplished. Allah ever keeps a meticulous record even though they may have forgotten it. For, Allah is Witness over all things.
Do you not realize that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. There is no secret meeting of three but He is their fourth, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor of less than that or more but He is with them wherever they may be. And ultimately, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they truly accomplished. Verily, Allah is Knower of all things.
Have you not noticed those who were forbidden to conspire in secret meetings, and yet they revert to what they were forbidden, and continue to conspire together - for hampering progress, creating wedges of dissension in the society, and disobedience of the Messenger? And when they come to you (O Messenger), they greet you not in the way that Allah greets you - And say to themselves, "Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?" Sufficient for them is Hell (in both lives) wherein they burn. And how miserable that destination is!
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When you consult with one another confidentially, never consult aiming hampering progress of the community, nor in creating wedges of discord therein, and disobedience of the Messenger. But consult together for expansion of individual and social potential and seeking ways to facilitate collective right conduct. And always remain mindful of Allah unto Whom you all shall be gathered. (And all your actions end up facing His Law of Requital in both lives).
Behold, conspiracy comes forth from selfish desire, in the end causing grief to the believers, but it cannot harm them contrary to Divine Laws. Hence, in Allah should the believers put their trust. (Satan or the selfish desire cannot overwhelm the believers unless they forsake Divine Commands (15:42), (17:65), (38:83)).
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When you are told, "Accommodate one another in your collective life", do accommodate, seeing that Allah will open up His resources for you. And when you are told, "Rise up", do rise up to the occasion. Allah will exalt to high ranks those of you who truly believe in the Divine Commands, and who use the knowledge that they have been given. For, Allah is Aware of all you do. ('Fas-h' = Open up = Make room = Accommodate others).
O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Whenever you wish to confer with the Messenger by yourself, give something in charity to the needy or do an act of benevolence. That will be for your own good and cleanse the imprints of your faults on your 'Self'. But if you have no opportunity, then, behold, Allah is Absolver of faults, Merciful. (He rewards good intentions).
Is it that you are afraid of a transgression if you are not able to do such an act of kindness before you confer with the Messenger? Yet if you fail to find an opportunity to do it, Allah has already accepted your repentance (58:12). Hence, stay focused on establishing Salat - the Divine System, and setting up the Just Economic Order of Zakat. And obey Allah and His Messenger. For, Allah is Aware of all you do.
Have you not seen those who befriend a people whom Allah disapproves? They are neither of you nor of them, and they knowingly swear on falsehood.
Allah has readied for them a severe suffering. Behold, very disruptive is their behavior indeed.
They use their oaths as cover and bar others from the Path of Allah. So theirs will be a shameful doom.
Their wealth and their children and party will avail them not against Allah. It is they who are companions of the Fire, therein to abide.
On the Day, when Allah will raise them together, all of them, they will then swear unto Him as they now swear unto you - deeming themselves to be accepted as reliable. Nay! Verily, it is they, they who are the liars.
Their selfish desire has overpowered them, and made them oblivious to Allah's Reminder. Such as these are the party of the Satan. Oh, verily, it is they, the Satan's party who are the ultimate losers.
Verily, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, it is they who will finally be brought low.
For, Allah has decreed, "I shall dominate, I and My Messengers." Behold, Allah is Strong, Almighty.
You will not find those who truly believe in Allah and the Last Day endear anyone who opposes Allah and His Messenger, even though they be their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their tribe. Allah has inscribed conviction on their hearts, and has strengthened them with Energy from Himself. Hence, He will admit them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Well pleased is Allah with them, and well pleased are they with Him. They are the party of Allah. Oh, verily, it is they, the party of Allah, who are truly successful.
