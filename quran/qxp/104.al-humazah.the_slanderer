Woe unto every slanderer, fault-finder! (He himself does little but spends a lot of energy detracting the doers).
Whose efforts revolve around gathering material possessions and counting them. (Devoid of a higher goal, he opposes any semblance of reform (70:18)).
Thinking as if his wealth will help him for forever!
Nay, he will be flung into the Shredder. (9:35).
Ah, what will convey to you what the Shredder is?
A Fire kindled by Allah.
Which originates in the hearts. (And engulfs the hearts).
Verily, it closes upon them. (As they had kept their possessions closed in safes and vaults, and kept all kindness surrounded in the flames of jealousy).
In extended columns.
