HAST THOU ever considered [the kind of man] who gives the lie to all moral law? 1
Behold, it is this [kind of man] that thrusts the orphan away,
and feels no urge 2 to feed the needy.
Woe, then, unto those praying ones
whose hearts from their prayer are remote 3-
those who want only to be seen and praised,
and, withal, deny all assistance [to their fellow-men]! 4
