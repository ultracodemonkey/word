CONSIDER the bright morning hours,
and the night when it grows still and dark.*
Thy Sustainer has not forsaken thee, nor does He scorn thee:*
for, indeed, the life to come will be better for thee than this earlier part [of thy life]!
And, indeed, in time will thy Sustainer grant thee [what thy heart desires], and thou shalt be well-pleased.
Has He not found thee an orphan, and given thee shelter?*
And found thee lost on thy way, and guided thee?
And found thee in want, and given thee sufficiency?
Therefore, the orphan shalt thou never wrong,
and him that seeks [thy] help shalt thou never chide,*
and of thy Sustainer's blessings shalt thou [ever] speak.*
