CONSIDER the heavens and that which comes in the night!*
And what could make thee conceive what it is that comes in the night?
It is the star that pierces through [life's] darkness:
[for] no human being has ever been left unguarded.*
LET MAN, then, observe out of what he has been created:
he has been created out of a seminal fluid
issuing from between the loins [of man] and the pelvic arch [of woman].*
Now, verily, He [who thus creates man in the first instance] is well able to bring him back [to life]
on the Day when all I secrets will be laid bare,
and [man] will have neither strength nor helper!
Consider* the heavens, ever-revolving,
and the earth, bursting forth with plants!
BEHOLD, this [divine writ] is indeed a word that between truth and falsehood,*
and is no idle tale.
Behold, they [who refuse to accept it] devise many a false argument* [to disprove its truth];
but I shall bring all their scheming to nought.*
Let, then, the deniers of the truth have their will: let them have their will for a little while!
