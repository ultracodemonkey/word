YOU ARE OBSESSED by greed for more and more
until you go down to your graves. 1
Nay, in time you will come to understand!
And once again: 2 Nay, in time you will come to understand!
Nay, if you could but understand [it] with an understanding [born] of certainty,
you would indeed, most surely, behold the blazing fire [of hell]! 3
In the end you will indeed, most surely, behold it with the eye of certainty: 4
and on that Day you will most surely be called to account for [what you did with] the boon of life!
