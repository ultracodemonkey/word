BEHOLD, from on high have We bestowed this [divine writ] on Night of Destiny. 1
And what could make thee conceive what it is, that Night of Destiny?
The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months: 2
in hosts descend in it the angels, 3 bearing divine inspiration 4 by their Sustainer's leave; from all [evil] that may happen
does it make secure, 5 until the rise of dawn.
