WOE UNTO THOSE who give short measure:
those who, when they are to receive their due from [other] people, demand that it be given in full -
but when they have to measure or weigh whatever they owe to others, give less than what is due!*
Do they not know that they are bound to be raised from the dead
[and called to account] on an awesome Day -
the Day when all men shall stand before the Sustainer of all the worlds?
NAY, VERILY, the record of the wicked is indeed [set down] in a mode inescapable!*
And what could make thee conceive what that that mode inescapable will be?
A record [indelibly] inscribed!
Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth -
those who give the lie to the [coming of] Judgment Day:
for, none gives the lie to it but such as are wont to transgress against all that is [and are] immersed in sin:*
[and so,] whenever Our messages are conveyed to them, they but say, "Fables of ancient times!"
Nay, but their hearts are corroded by all [the evil] that they were wont to do!*
Nay, verily, from [the grace of] their Sustainer shall they on that Day be debarred;
and then, behold, they shall enter the blazing fire
and be told: "This is the [very thing] to which you were wont to give the lie!"
NAY, VERILY - the record of the truly virtuous is [set down] in a mode most lofty!*
And what could make thee conceive what that mode most lofty will be?
A record [indelibly] inscribed,
witnessed by all who have [ever] been drawn close unto God.*
Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous will indeed be in bliss:
[restingJ on couches, they will look up [to God]:*
upon their faces thou wilt see the brightness of bliss.
They will be given a drink of pure wine whereon the seal [of God] will have been set,
pouring forth with a fragrance of musk.* To that [wine of paradise], then, let all such aspire as [are willing to] aspire to things of high account:
for it is composed of all that is most exalting*
a source [of bliss] whereof those who are drawn close unto God shall drink.*
BEHOLD, those who have abandoned themselves to sin are wont to laugh at such as have attained to faith*
and whenever they pass by them, they wink at one another [derisively];
and whenever they return to people of their own kind,* they return full of jests;
and whenever they see those [who believe,] they say, "Behold, these [people] have indeed gone astray!"
And, withal, they have no call to watch over [the beliefs of] others. . .*
But on the Day [of Judgment], they who had attained to faith will [be able to] laugh at the [erstwhile] deniers of the truth:*
[for, resting in paradise] on couches, they will look on [and say to themselves]:
"Are these deniers of the truth being [thus] requited for [aught but] what they were wont to do?"
