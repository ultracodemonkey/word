WOE unto every slanderer, fault-finder! 1
[Woe unto him 2] who amasses wealth and counts it a safeguard,
thinking that his wealth will make him live forever! 3
Nay, but [in the life to come such as] he shall indeed be abandoned to crushing torment! 4
And what could make thee conceive what that crushing torment will be?
A fire kindled by God,
which will rise over the [guilty] hearts: 5
verily, it will close in upon them
in endless columns! 6
