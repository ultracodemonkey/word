HAVE WE NOT opened up thy heart,*
and lifted from thee the burden
that had weighed so heavily on thy back?*
And [have We not] raised thee high in dignity?*
And, behold, with every hardship comes ease:
verily, with every hardship comes ease!
Hence, when thou art freed [from distress], remain steadfast,
and unto thy Sustainer turn with love.
