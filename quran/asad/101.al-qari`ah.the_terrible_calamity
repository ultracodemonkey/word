OH, the sudden calamity! 1
How awesome the sudden calamity!
And what could make thee conceive what that sudden calamity will be?
[It will occur] on the Day when men will be like moths swarming in confusion,
and the mountains will be like fluffy tufts of wool. . . .
And then, he whose weight [of good deeds] is heavy in the balance
shall find himself in a happy' state of life;
whereas he whose weight is light in the balance
shall be engulfed by an abyss. 2
And what could make thee conceive what that [abyss] will be?
A fire hotly burning! 3
