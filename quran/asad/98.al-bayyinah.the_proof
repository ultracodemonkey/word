IT IS NOT [conceivable] that such as are bent on denying the truth - [be they] from among the followers of earlier revelation or from among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God 1 - should ever be abandoned [by Him] ere there comes unto them the [full] evidence of the truth:
an apostle from God, conveying [unto them] revelations blest with purity,
wherein there are ordinances of ever-true soundness and clarity. 2
Now those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime 3 did break up their unity [of faith] after such an evidence of the truth had come to them. 4
And withal, they were not enjoined aught but that they should worship God, sincere in their faith in Him alone, turning away from all that is false; 5 and that they should be constant in prayer; and that they should spend in charity: 6 for this is a moral law endowed with ever-true soundness and clarity. 7
Verily, those who [despite all evidence] are bent on denying the truth 8 - [be they] from among the followers of earlier revelation or from among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God - will find themselves in the fire of hell, therein to abide: they are the worst of all creatures.
[And,] verily, those who have attained to faith, and do righteous deeds - it is they, they who are the best of all creatures.
Their reward [awaits them] with God: gardens of perpetual bliss, through which running waters flow, therein to abide beyond the count of time; well-pleased is God with them, and well-pleased are they with Him: all this awaits him who of his Sustainer stands in awe!
