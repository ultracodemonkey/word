In the name of god, the most gracious, The dispenser of grace:*
ALL PRAISE is due to God alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds,*
the Most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace,
Lord of the Day of Judgment!
Thee alone do we worship; and unto Thee alone do we turn for aid.
Guide us the straight way -
the way of those upon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings,* not of those who have been condemned [by Thee], nor of those who go astray!**
