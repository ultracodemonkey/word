WHEN THE EARTH quakes with her [last] mighty quaking,
and [when] the earth yields up her burdens, 1
and man cries out, "What has happened to her?" -
on that Day will she recount all her tidings,
as thy Sustainer will have inspired her to do! 2
On that Day will all men come forward, cut off from one another, 3 to be shown their [past] deeds.
And so, he who shall have done an atom's weight of good, shall behold it;
and he who shall have done an atom's weight of evil, shall behold it.
