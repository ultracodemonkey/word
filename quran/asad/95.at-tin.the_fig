CONSIDER the fig and the olive,
and Mount Sinai,
and this land secure!*
Verily, We create man in the best conformation;*
and thereafter We reduce him to the lowest of low* -
excepting only such as attain to faith and do good works: and theirs shall be a reward unending!
What, then, [O man,] could henceforth cause thee to give the lie to this moral law?*
Is not God the most just of judges?
