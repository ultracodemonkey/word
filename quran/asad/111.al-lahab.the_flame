DOOMED are the hands of him of the glowing countennce: 1 and doomed is he!
What will his wealth avail him, and all that he has gained?
[In the life to come] he shall have to endure a fire fiercely glowing; 2
together with his wife, that carrier of evil tales, 3
[who bears] around her neck a rope of twisted strands! 4
