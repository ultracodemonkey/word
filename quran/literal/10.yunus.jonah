A L R, those are the wise/judicious Book's verses/evidences.
Was it to the people astonishment/surprise that We inspired/transmitted to a man from them: "That warn/give notice (to) the people and announce good news (to) those who believed that for them (is) a foot (hold) (of) truth at their Lord." The disbelievers said: "That, that (is) an evident magician/sorcerer."
That your Lord (is) God who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth in six days then He aimed to/tended to on the throne, He plans/regulates the matter/affair, (there is) no/none from a mediator except from after His permission/pardon, that one (is) God, your Lord, so worship Him, so do you not mention/remember/praise ?
To Him (is) your return all/all together, God's promise truthfully, that He truly starts/initiates the creation, then He returns/repeats it to reward/reimburse those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds with the just/equitable, and those who disbelieved for them (is) a drink from hot/cold water and a painful torture because (of) what they were disbelieving.
He is who made/put the sun light/shining and the moon a light, and He predestined/evaluated it places of descent/sequences/descents to know (the) number/numerous (of) the years and the counting/calculating, God did not create that except with the truth, He details/explains the verses/evidences to a nation knowing.
That in difference (of) the night and the daytime and what God created in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (are) signs/evidences (E) to a nation fearing and obeying.
That those who do not hope/expect meeting Us, and they accepted/approved with the life the present/the worldly life, and they became assured/secured with it, and those who they are from Our verses/evidences ignoring/disregarding.
Those, their shelter/refuge (is) the fire because (of) what they were acquiring/gathering.
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, their Lord guides them because of their faith/belief (to) the rivers flowing/running from below/beneath them in the blessing/goodness (of) treed gardens/paradises.
Their call/prayer in it (is): "Oh/you God Your praise/glory." And their greeting in it (is): "Security/peace." and their last call/prayer (is): "That the praise/gratitude (is) to God the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
And if God hurries/hastens the bad/evil/harm to the people (as) their hurrying/hastening with the good/wealth, their term/time would have been executed/accomplished to them, so We leave those who do not expect meeting Us in their tyranny/arrogance being confused/puzzled.
And if the human (was) touched (by) the harm he called Us to his side or sitting or standing, so when We removed/uncovered from him his harm, he passed as if/though he did not call Us to harm (that) touched him,as/like that (it) was decorated/beautified to the spoilers/neglecters what they were making/doing.
And We had destroyed the generations/peoples of eras from before you, when they caused injustice/oppression, and their messengers came to them with the evidences, and they were not to believe, as/like that We reward/reimburse the nation the criminals/sinners.
Then We made/put you (as) caliphs/successors and replacers/leaders in the earth/Planet Earth from after them to see how you do.
And if Our signs/verses evidences are read/recited on them, those who do not hope/expect meeting Us said: "Come/bring with a Koran other than that or exchange/replace it." Say: "(It) is not to me that I exchange/replace it from my self/spontaneously/willingly that I follow except what is inspired/revealed to me, that I fear if I disobeyed my Lord (from) a great day's torture."
Say: " If God wanted/willed I would not (have) read/recited it on you, and He would not (have) informed you with (of) it, so I had stayed/remained in (between) you a life time from before it, so do you not reason/understand ?
So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on God lies/denials/falsifications or lied/falsified with His verses/evidences ? That He does not make the criminals/sinners succeed/win
And they worship from other than God what does not harm them and nor benefit them, and they say: "Those (are) our mediators at God." Say: "Do you inform God with what He does not know in the skies/space and nor in the earth/Planet Earth?" His praise/glory and high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they share/make partners (with God).
And the people were not except one nation, so they differed/disagreed/disputed, and where it not for a word preceded from your Lord, (it) would have executed/ended (E) between them, in what they are in it differing/disagreeing.
And they say: "If only an evidence/sign was descended on him from his Lord." So say: "But the absent/supernatural (is) to God so wait, that I am with you from the waiting.
And if We made the people taste/experience mercy from after calamity/disastrous distress touched them, then for them (is) cheatery/deceit/schemes in Our verses/evidences. Say: "God (is) quicker/faster (in) cunning/scheming, that Our messengers write what you cheat/ deceive/scheme."
He is who makes you walk/move/ride in the shore/land and the sea (large body of water) until when you were in the ships, and We flowed/ran with them with a good/enjoyable wind/breeze, and they became happy/rejoiced with it, (then) a stormy/violent wind came to it, and the waves/surges came to them from every place, and they thought/assumed that they are (being) surrounded/encircled with them, they called God faithful/loyal/devoted for Him (in) the religion: "If (E) you saved/rescued us from this, we will become (E) from the thankful/grateful."
So when He saved/rescued them, then they oppress/transgress/corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth without the right, you, you the people but your oppression/transgression (is) on yourselves the life the present's/worldly life's long life/enjoyment, then to Us (is) your return, so We inform you with what you were making/doing.137
But the life the present's/worldly life's example (is) as/like water, We descended it from the sky, so the Earth's/land's plant mixed/mingled with it, from what the people eat and the camels/livestock, until the earth/land took its decoration/beauty and it became decorated/beautified, and its people thought/assumed that they are capable/overpowering on it, (then) Our order/matter came to/destroyed it at night or (at) daytime, so We made it uprooted as though it did not enrich/be inhabited by the yesterday/previous day, as/like that We detail/explain/clarify the verses/evidences to a nation thinking.
And God, He calls to the safety's/security's/peace's home/house, and He guides whom He wills/wants to a straight/direct way/road.
To those who did good, the best/most beautiful/goodness and an increase (more), and no smoke/dust and nor humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses/oppresses their faces, those are the treed garden's/paradise's owners/company they are in it immortally/eternally.
And (to) those who gathered/acquired the sins/crimes (a) reimbursement (of) a sin/crime with similar/equal to it and humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses/oppresses them, none from (a) protector/shelterer (is) for them from (other than) God, as though their faces (are) covered/darkened (with) parts/portions (of) the darkened night. Those are the fire's owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally.
And a day We gather them all/all together, then We say to those who shared/made partners (with God): "Your place/position, you and your partners (with God)." So We separated/dispersed between them, and their partners (with God) said: "You were not us worshipping."
So enough/sufficient with God (as) a witness/testifier between us and between you, if we were about your worshipping ignoring/neglecting (E).
At that place and time every self will find it is foolish what it advanced, and they were returned to God their owner/master the true, and what they were fabricating misguided/nullified from them.
Say: "Who provides for you from the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth? Or who owns/possesses the hearing/listening, and the eye sights/knowledge, and He brings out/emerges the live/alive from the dead, and He brings out/emerges the dead from the live/alive, and who plans/regulates the matter/affair?" So they will say: "God." so say: "So do you not fear and obey?"
So that one (is) God, your Lord the truth, so what after the truth (is there) except the misguidance, so how/where (do) you be sent away/diverted?
As/like that your Lord's word/expression became correct/true, on those who debauched, that they do not believe.
Say: "Are there from your partners (with God) who starts/initiates the creation then he repeats it?" Say: "God starts/initiates the creation, then He repeats it. So how/where (do) you lie/turn away?"
Say: "Are there from your partners (with God) who guides to the truth ?" Say: "God guides to the truth.Is who guides to the truth more worthy/deserving that He be followed or who does not guide except that he be guided, so what (is it) for you how you judge/rule?"138
And most of them do not follow except assumption/supposition, that the assumption/supposition does not suffice (replace) from the truth a thing, that God (is) knowledgeable with what they make/do.
And this the Koran was/is not that it be fabricated from (by) other than God, and but confirmation (of) what (is) between his (Prophet Mohammad's) hands, and detailing/explaining The Book, no doubt/suspicion in it, (it is) from the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
Or they say: "He fabricated it." Say: "So come/bring with a chapter of the Koran similar/equal to it and call whom you were able from other than God, if you were truthful."
But they lied/denied/falsified with what they did not comprehend with its knowledge, and its interpretation/explanation did not come to them, as/like those from before them lied/denied/falsified, so look/see how the unjusts'/oppressives' end/turn was.
And from them who believed with it, and from them who does not believe with it, and your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with the corrupting.
And if they lied/denied you, so say: "For me (is) my deed, and for you (is) your deed, you are innocent/renouncing from what I make/do, and I am innocent/renouncing from what you make/do."
And from them who listen/hear to you, so do you make the deaf hear/listen and (even) if they were not reasoning/understanding ?
And from them who looks to you, so do you guide the blind/confused and (even) if they were not seeing/understanding ?
That God, does not cause injustice/oppression (to) the people a thing and but the people themselves cause injustice/oppression.
And a day He gathers them as though they did not remain/wait except an hour from the daytime, getting to know each other, those who lied/denied with meeting God had lost, and they were not guided.
And either We show you some/part (of) which/that We promise them, or We make you die, so to Us (is) their return, then God (is) witnessing on what they make/do.
And to each/every nation/generation (is) a messenger, so if their messenger came, judgment was passed between them with the just/equitable, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
And they say: "When/at what time (is) that the promise if you were truthful?"
Say: "I do not own/possess to myself harm and nor benefit/usefulness except, what God willed/wanted, to every/each nation/generation (is) a term/time, if their term/time came, so they do not delay/lag behind an hour, and nor advance/precede."
Say: "Did you see/understand if His torture came to you at night/suddenly at night/overnight or day time, what (do) the criminals/sinners hurry/rush/urge from Him?"
Is it then when (it) happened! (expression of wonderment) you believed with it/Him now, and you had been with it/Him hurrying/hastening.
Then (it) was said to those who caused injustice/oppression: "Taste/experience the immortality's/eternity's torture,139are you being reimbursed except because (of) what you were gathering/acquiring ?
And they ask you to inform them: "Is it correct ?" Say: "Yes and (by) my Lord, that it truly is correct (E), and you are not with disabling/frustrating."
And if to every self (that) caused injustice/oppression what is in the earth/Planet Earth, it would have ransomed/compensated with it, and they kept the regret/sorrow/remorse secret when they saw/understood the torture, and was passed judgment/ordered between them with the just/equitable, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
Is not to God what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, is not God's promise true, and but most of them do not know?
He revives/makes alive and He makes die, and to Him you are being returned.
You, you the people, a sermon/advice/warning had come to you from your Lord, and a cure/recovery to what (is) in the chests (innermosts), and guidance, and mercy to the believers.
Say: "With God's grace/favour and His mercy, so with that so they should be happy/rejoiced, He/it is better from what they gather/collect."
Say: "Did you see/understand what God descended for you from provision so you made/created from it forbidden/prohibited and permitted/allowed?" Say: "Did God permit/allow for you, or on God you fabricate/cut and split?
And what (is in the) thought/assumption (on) the Resurrection Day (of) those who fabricate on God the lie/falsehood ? That God (is owner) of (E) grace/favour/blessing on the people, and but most of them do not thank/be grateful.
And you (do) not be in a matter/affair, and what you read/recite from it from Koran, and you do not make/do from deed(s) except (that) We were on you witnessing when you rush/hurry in it, and none from a weight (of) a smallest particle (smaller than an atom) in the earth/Planet Earth and nor in the sky/ space, and nor smaller/littler than that, and nor greater/magnified is far, hidden and distant from your Lord, except (it is) in an evident/clear Book.
Is it not that God's patrons/followers (that there is) no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving?
Those who believed and were fearing and obeying.
For them the good news in the life the present/the worldly life and in the end (other life), (there is) no exchange/replacement/substitution to God's words/expressions, that it is the winning/triumph, the great.
And (let) not their saying/word/opinion and belief to sadden you, that the glory/might (is) to God all/wholly, He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
Is it not that to God who (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth? And those who call from other than God partners, (they) do not follow (anything) except the assumption/supposition, and that they (are) except lying/speculating.
He is who made/created for you the night to be tranquil/quiet in it, and the daytime to see, that in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation hearing/listening.140
They said: "God took/received a child (son)." His praise/glory He is the rich, for Him what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, at you (is) no proof/evidence with that, are you saying on God what you do not know?
Say: "That those who fabricate/cut and split on God the lies/falsehood do not succeed/win."
Long life/enjoyment in the present world then to Us (is) their return, then We make them taste/experience the torture the strong (severe) because (of) what they were disbelieving.
And read/recite on them Noah's information/news, when he said to his nation: "You (my) nation, if my place/position and my reminding/mentioning with Gods' evidences/verses had become a burden on you, so on God I relied/depended, so gather/collect/unify your matter/affair and your partners (with God), then your matter/affair be not on you ambiguous/vague (covert), then pass judgment/order to me, and do not give me time/delay me."
So if you turned away, so I did not ask/demand (of) you from a reward/wage that my reward/wage (is) except on God, and I was ordered/commanded, that I be from the Moslems/submitters.
So they denied him, so We saved/rescued him and who (was) with him in the ship, and We made/put them (as) caliphs/successors and replacers/leaders, and We drowned/sunk those who lied/denied/falsified with Our evidences/verses, so look/see how was the end/turn (result of) the warned/given notice.
Then We sent from after him messengers to their nations, so they came to them with the evidences/verses, so they were not to believe with what they lied/denied/falsified with it from before, as/like that We stamp/cover/seal on the transgressors'/violators'/breakers' hearts/minds.
Then (E) We sent from after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his nobles/groups/assembly with Our verses/evidences, so they became arrogant and they were a nation (of) criminals/sinners.
So when the truth came to them from at Us, they said: "That truly (is) evident magic/sorcery (E)."
Moses Said: "Do you say to the truth when it came to you, is that magic/sorcery?" and the magicians/sorcerers do not succeed/win.
They said: "Did you come to us to turn us away (divert us) from what we found our fathers on it, and the arrogance/greatness be to you (B) in the earth/Planet Earth, and we are not to you (B) with believing."
And Pharaoh said: "Bring to me with every knowledgeable magician/sorcerer."
So when the magicians/sorcerers came, Moses Said: "Throw/throw away what you are throwing/throwing away."
So when they threw/threw away Moses said: "What the magic/sorcery you came with it, that truly God will waste/annul/cancel it, that truly God does not correct/repair (the) deeds (of) the corrupting."
And God corrects the truth with His words/expressions, and even if the criminals/sinners hated (it).
So did not believe in Moses except descendants from his nation on fear from Pharaoh and their nobles/groups/assembly that he (Pharaoh) tortures them, and that Pharaoh (is) high and mighty (E) in the earth/planet Earth, and that he (is) from (E) the spoilers/exceeders of the limit.
And Moses said: "You (my) nation if you had believed by God, so on Him rely/depend if you were Moslems/submitters."141
So they said: "On God we relied/depended. Our Lord do not make/put us (as a) test to the nation the unjust/oppressors."
And save/rescue us with Your mercy from the nation the disbelievers.
And We inspired/transmitted to Moses and his brother that you (B) reside/establish houses/homes to your (B)'s nation by a city/border/region/Egypt, and make your houses/homes direction, and keep up the prayers, and announce good news (to) the believers.
And Moses said: "Our Lord, that You, You gave/brought Pharaoh and his nobles/assembly decoration/beauty/ornament and properties/possessions/wealth in the present world/worldly life, our Lord, to misguide (E) from Your way/path, our Lord wipe out/destroy on their properties/possessions/wealths and stamp/hit on their hearts/minds so they do not believe until they see the torture the painful."
He said: "Your (B)'s call/request/prayer had been answered/replied to, so be straight/direct, and do not follow (the) way/path (of) those who do not know."
And We crossed/passed/passed through with Israel's sons and daughters the sea, so Pharaoh and his soldiers/warriors followed them (with) transgression and violating/breaking until when the drowning/sinking caught up/overtook him, he said: "I believed that He is, no God except who Israel's descendants believed with Him, and I am from the Moslems/submitters."
Now, and you had disobeyed before, and you were from the corrupting ?
So the day/today We save/rescue you with your body/top set (of) armor to be to who (is) behind you an evidence/sign, and that many from the people (are) from Our evidences/verses/signs ignoring/disregarding (E).
And We had resided/settled to Israel's sons and daughters truthful residence/settlement, and We provided for them from the goodnesses, so they did not differ/disagree/dispute until the knowledge came to them, that your Lord passes judgment (settles) between them (in) the Resurrection Day in what they were in it differing/disagreeing/disputing.
So if you were in doubt/suspicion from what We descended to you, so ask/question those who read The Book from before you, the truth had come to you from your Lord, so do not be from the doubting/arguing.
And do not be from those who lied/denied/falsified with God's verses/evidences/signs, so you be from the losers.
That those who God's word/expression (was) deserved on them do not believe.
And even if every/each verse/evidence/sign came to them, until they see/understand the torture the painful.
So where it not for a village/urban city (that) believed, so its faith/belief benefited it, except Jonah's/Yonis' nation, when they believed We removed/uncovered (relieved) from them the shameful/scandalous/disgraceful torture in the present world/worldly life, and We gave them long life/made they enjoy to a time.
And if your Lord wanted/willed who is in the earth/Planet Earth all of them, all/all together would have believed (E), so do you compel/force the people until they be believers/believing?
And (it) was not to a self that she/it believes except with God's permission, and He makes/puts the142obscenity/filth on those who do not reason/understand/comprehend.
Say: "Look/see, what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and the evidences/verses, and the warning/notices do not satisfy/suffice from a nation (that) do not believe."
So do they wait/watch (for) except as/like days/times (of) those who past/expired from before them, Say: "So wait/watch, that I am with you from the waiting/watching."
Then We save/rescue Our messengers and those who believed, as/like that truthfully on Us We save/rescue the believers.
Say: "You, you the people, if you were in doubt/suspicion of/from my religion, so I do not worship those whom you worship from other than God, and but I worship God who makes you die, and I was ordered/commanded that I be from the believers."
And that stand/keep up your face/front/direction to the religion (as) a submitter/Unifier of God, and do not be from the sharers/takers of partners (with God).
And do not call from other than God what does not benefit you and does not harm you, so if you made/did, so that you are then from the unjust/oppressors.
And if God touches you with harm, so (there is) no remover/uncoverer (reliever) to it except Him, and if He wants/wills/intends you with goodness/generosity, so (there is) no returner for His grace/favour/blessing, He strikes/hits with it whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, and He is the forgiving, the merciful.
Say: "You, you the people, the truth had come to you from your Lord, so who was guided, so but he guides for his self, and who misguided, so but he misguides on it, and I am not on you with a guardian/protector."
And follow what is inspired/transmitted to you, and be patient until God judges/rules, and He is best (of) the judges/rulers. 143
