And from the people, who argues/disputes in (about) God without knowledge, and He follows every rebellious/mutinous devil.
It was written/decreed on him that who followed him (the devil), that he (the devil) misguides him, and he (the devil) guides him to the torture, the blazing/inflamed.
You, you the people, if you were in doubt/suspicion from the resurrection/revival, so We created you from dust/earth, then from a drop/males' or female's secretion/little water, then from a blood clot/sperm/semen, then from a piece of something chew able of flesh or other evened/smoothed/kneadable, and other than (that) not evened/smoothed/kneadable, to clarify/explain to you, and We settle/establish in the wombs/uteruses what We will/want to a named/identified term/time, then We bring you out (as) a child/children, then to reach your maturity/strength, and from you who (is) made to die, and from you who is returned to the life time's worst/meanest, so that he not know from after knowledge a thing, and you see/understand the earth/Planet Earth quiet/lifeless, so if We descended on it the water, it shook/moved, and it grew/increased, and it sprouted/grew from every pair delightful/cheering.

Turning his neck violently objecting to misguide from God's way/path, for him in the present world (is) shame/scandal/disgrace, and We make him taste/experience (on) the Resurrection Day the burning's torture.
That (is) because (of) what your hands advanced/introduced, and that God is not with an unjust/oppressor to the worshippers/slaves.
And from the people who worships God on edge, so if goodness struck/marked him he became assured/secured with it, and if test/betrayal/torture struck/marked him, he returned on his face/front, he lost the present world and the end (other life), that (is) the loss/misguidance and punishment, the clear/evident.
He calls from other than God what does not harm him and what does not benefit him, that (is) the misguidance thefar/distant.
He calls who (E) his harm (is) nearer/closer than his benefit, how bad (E) (is) the ally, and how bad (E) (is) the associate/companion ?

Those two, two disputers/adversaries disputed/controverted/argued in their Lord, so those who disbelieved, clothes/garments/dresses were cut for them from fire, the hot/cold water is being poured from above their heads.
What is in their bellies/insides and the skins is being melted/anointed with it.
And for them (are) sticks from iron.

Then they should carry out/accomplish (remove/cleanse) their filth/dirt, and they should fulfill/complete their duties/vows (on themselves), and they should circle/walk around at the House/Home, the Honoured/Ancient.
That and who magnifies/makes great God's ordered prohibitions, so it is better for him at his Lord, and the camels/livestock is permitted/allowed for you, except what is being read/recited on (to) you, so avoid the obscenity/filth from the idols/idolized statues, and avoid the lie's/falsehood's word/opinion and belief.
