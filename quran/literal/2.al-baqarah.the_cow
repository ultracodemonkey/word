AL M
That The Book no doubt/suspicion in it, (it is) guidance to the fearing and obeying.
Those who believe with the unseen/hidden and they keep up/call for the prayers and from what We provided for them they spend.
And those who believe with what was descended to you, and what was descended from before you, and with the end (other life) they are sure/certain.
Those are on a guidance from their Lord and those are the successful/winners.
That those who disbelieved, (it is) equal/alike on (to) them, had you warned them, or you did not warn them, (notice) they do not believe.
God sealed/stamped on their hearts/minds and on their hearing and on their eye sights/understanding a cover and for them (is) a great torture.
And from the people who say: "We believed by God and with the Day the Last/ Resurrection Day." And they are not with believing.
They deceive God, and those who believed, and they do not deceive except themselves, and they do not feel/know/sense.
In their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, so God increased them sickness/disease, and for them (is a) painful torture because (of) what they were lying/denying/falsifying.
And if (it was) said to them: "Do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth." They said: "But we are correcting/repairing."
Is it not that they truly are, they are the corrupting and but they do not feel/know/sense?
And if (it was/is) said to them: "Believe as the people believed." They said: "Do we believe as the ignorant/foolish believed?" Is it not that they truly are, they are the ignorant/foolish and but they do not know?
And if they met/found those who believed, they said: "We believed". And if they were alone/together with to their devils they said: "That we are with you, but we are mocking."
God moc ks with (about) them and extends/spreads them in their tyranny (being) confused/puzzled.
Those are those who bought/volunteered the misguidance with the guidance, so their commercial trade/buying and selling did not profit/gain, and they were not guided.
Their example (is) as the one who ignited a fire, so when it lit/illuminated what (is) around/surrounding him, God took/went away with their light, and left them in darknesses, they do not see/understand.
Deaf, mute, blind, so they do not return.
Or as a rain from the sky, in it (is) darknesses and thunder and lightning, they put their fingers intheir ears from the thunderous noise, fearing the death, and God (is) with the disbelievers surrounding/enveloping.
The lightning almost snatches their eye sights, whenever (it) lit for them they walked in it, and if (it) darkened on them they stood and if God willed/wanted, He would have gone/taken away with their hearing/sense of hearing, and their sights/understanding, that God (is) on every thing capable/powerful.
You, you the people worship your Lord who created you, and those from before you, maybe/perhaps you fear and obey (God).
Who made/created for you the earth/Planet Earth a spread, and the sky/space a structure and descended from the sky water, so He brought out with it from the fruits a provision for you, so do not make/create to God equals (idols) and you are knowing.
And if you were in doubt/suspicion from what We descended on Our worshipper/slave, so come/bring with a chapter from its similar/equal/alike to it, and call your witnesses/testifiers from other than God, if you were truthful.
So if you do not make/do and you will never make/do, so fear the fire, that/which its fuel (is) the people and the stones, (it) was/is prepared to the disbelievers.
And announce good news (to) those who believe and did/made the correct/righteous deeds, that to them (are) treed gardens the rivers flow from beneath it. Whenever they (were) provided for from it from a fruit a provision,they said: "This (is) what we were provided for from before." And they were given with it similar, and for them in it (are) purified spouses and they are in it immortally/eternally.
That God does not (feel) shame that (He) gives/strikes an example, (of) any a mosquito (and) so what (is) above it, so but those who believed, so they know that it (is) the truth from their Lord, and but those who disbelieved, so they say: "What did God want/intend with that (as) an example/proverb?" He misguides with it many, and He guides with it many, and He does not misguide with it except the debauchers.
Those who break God's promise/contract (their promise to God) from after its affirmation, and they cut/sever what God ordered with it that (it) be reached/connected, and they corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth, those they are the losers.
How do you disbelieve with God and you were deads, so He revived you, then He makes you die, then He revives you, then to Him you are being returned.
He (is), who created for you what (is) in the land/earth/Planet Earth all together/wholly, then He tended to the sky/space, so He straightened them (into) seven skies/space(s), and He is with every thing knowledgeable.
And when your Lord said to the angels: "That I am making/creating/putting in the earth a caliph/successor/leader." They said: "Do you make/create/put in it, who corrupts in it and sheds the blood, and we praise/glorify with Your praise and we (continue to admit Your) holiness/sanctity to You." He said: "I know what you do not know."
And He taught Adam the names, all of them, then He displayed/exhibited/showed them on (to) the angels, so He said: "Inform Me with (the) names (of) those, if you were truthful."
They said: "Your praise/glory, no knowledge to us except what You taught us, that You are the knowledgeable, the wise/judicious."
He said: "You, Adam, inform them with their names." so when he informed them with their names, He (God) said: "Did I not say to you, that I know the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's unseen and I know what you show, and what you were hiding/concealing."
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan, he refused/hated and became arrogant, and he was from the disbelievers.
And We said: "You Adam, reside/inhabit you and your wife/spouse the Paradise/treed garden, and you (B) eat from it easily/comfortably where/when you (B) wanted, and do not approach/near (B) this the tree, so you (B) become from the unjust/oppressors."
So the devil made them (B) slip/fall/sin from it, so he brought them (B) out from what they were (B) in it, and We said: "Descend/decline some of you to some (are) an enemy and for you in the earth/Planet Earth (is) settlement and long life/enjoyment to a time."
So Adam received from his Lord words/expressions, so (He) forgave on him, that He is, He is the forgiver, the most merciful.
We said: "Drop/decline from it, all together, so when a guidance from Me comes to you, so who followed My guidance, so no fear/fright on them and nor they be sad/grieving."
And those who disbelieved and denied with Our verses/evidences, those are the fire's owners/company, they (are) in it immortally/eternally.
You Israel's sons and daughters, remember My blessing, which I blessed on you, and fulfill/complete with My promise/contract, I fulfill/complete with your promise/contract, and (only) Me so be terrified/monkish of Me.
And believe with what I descended, confirming to what (is) with you, and do not be (the) first disbeliever with it, and do not buy/volunteer with My verses/evidences a small/little price, and (only) Me, so fear and obey Me.
And do not confuse/mix/cover the correct/truth with the falsehood, and you hide/conceal the correct/truth and you are knowing.
And keep up/take care of the prayers and give/bring the charity/purification and bow with the bowing.
Do you order the people with the righteousness/charitability and you forget yourselves, and you are reading/reciting The Book, do you not reason/understand/comprehend?
And seek support with the patience and the prayers and that it truly is a great/burden (E) except on the humble.
Those who suppose/think that they are meeting their lord and that they are to Him returning.
You Israel's sons and daughters, mention/remember My blessing that I blessed on you, and that I preferred/favoured you on the creations altogether/(universes).
And fear a day/time, no self rewards/substitutes from a self a thing, and no mediation (is to) be accepted/received from it, and no ransom/redemption (is to) be taken from it, and nor they be given victory.
And when/where We saved/rescued you, from Pharaoh's family, they burden/impose upon you (with) the torture's evil (worst), they slaughter your sons and they shame your women, and in that (is) a great test from your Lord.
And when/where We separated with you the sea, so We saved/rescued you, and We drowned/sunk Pharaoh's people and (while) you are looking/watching.
And when/where We promised Moses forty nights, then you took the calf from after him, and you are unjust/oppressive.
Then We forgave on you from after that, maybe you thank/be grateful.
And when We gave Moses The Book and the Separator of Right and Wrong, maybe you (will) be guided.
And when Moses said to his nation: "You my nation, that you caused injustice to yourselves, because (of) your taking the calf (to worship), so repent to your creator, so fight/kill yourselves, that is best for you at your creator." So, He forgave on you, that He is the forgiver, the most merciful.
And when you said: "You, Moses, we will never believe to you until we see God openly, so the death/cry of torture took/punished you, and you are looking/watching.
Then We revived/resurrected you from after your death/lifelessness, maybe you thank/be grateful.
And We overshadowed on you the clouds, and We descended on you the mana (sweet gluey substance) and the quails/amusement. Eat from (the) goodness (of) what We provided for you, and they did not cause injustice to Us, and but they were (to) themselves causing injustice.
And when We said: "Enter this village/urban city, so eat from it where/when you willed/wanted easily/comfortably and enter the door/entrance prostrating and say humility/forgiveness (be humble),We (will) forgive for you your sins/wrongs/mistakes, and We will increase the good doers.
Those who caused injustice/oppression, so (they) exchanged/replaced a saying other than what was said to them, so We descended on those who caused injustice/oppression, filth/torture from the sky/space with what they were debauching.
And when Moses asked for drink for his nation, so We said: "Hit/move/palpitate with your stick/cane the stone, so twelve water springs/wells burst/flowed from it, each people had known their drinking place. Eat and drink from God's provision and do not corrupt in the Earth/land corrupting/disordering."
And when you said: "You Moses, (we) will never be patient on one food, so call for us your lord (to) bring out for us from what the Earth/land sprouts/grows from its vegetables, and its long cucumber, and its legumes, and its lentils and its onions." He said: "Do you exchange/substitute what it isnearer/weaker/poorer with what it is good/best ? Descend/enter (to the) city/border/region/Egypt, so for you (there is) what you asked/demanded." And it is imposed/forced on them the humiliation/disgrace and the poverty/ oppression and they returned/resided with anger from God, (that is) because they were disbelieving with God's signs/verses/evidences, and (they) kill the prophets without the right, that (is) because (of) what they disobeyed, and they were transgressing/violating.
That those who believed and those who repented/guided/Jews, and the Christians and the Sabians/converts, who believed with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so for them their reward (is) at their lord, and no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving.
And when We took your promise/covenant, and We raised above you the mountain, take/receive what We gave you with strength/power, and mention/remember what (is) in it, maybe you fear and obey (God).
Then you turned away from after that, so where it not for God's grace/favour on you, and His mercy, you would have been from the losers
And you had known those who transgressed/violated from you in the Saturday/Sabbath, so We said to them: "Be lowly/ousted out monkeys/apes."
So We made it (a) severe exemplary punishment for what (is) between its hands and what (is) behind it, and (an) advice/warning, to the fearing and obeying.
And when Moses said to his nation: "That God orders/commands you that you slaughter a cow." They said: "Do you take us mockingly ?" He said: "I seek protection by God that I be from the lowly/ignorant."
They said: "Call for us your Lord He clarifies for us what it is." He (Moses) said: "That He says that it is a cow not (an) old aged animal, and nor first born/virgin, middle aged between that, so make/do what you are ordered/commanded."
They said: "Call for us your Lord, (to) clarify for us what its colour (is)." He said: "That He says, that it truly is a cow, yellowish, clear pure bright yellow its colour, it delights the lookers."
They said: "Call for us your Lord He clarifies to us what it is, that the cows looked alike/resembled (each other), on (to) us and that we are if God willed/wanted guided (E)."
He said: "That He says that it is a cow not manipulated/eased, it ploughs the earth, and does not water/irrigate the agricultural land/plants flawless, no marks/different colours in it." They said: "Now, you came with the truth/fact " So they slaughtered it, and they were not about to make/do (it).
And when you (P) killed a self, so you repelled (accusations amongst yourselves) in it, and God (is) bringing out what you were hiding/concealing.
So We said: "Mix/strike it with some of it." Like that God revives/makes alive the deads and He shows you His signs/verses/examples, maybe you reason/understand/comprehend
Then your hearts/minds became cruel/merciless from after that, so it is as the stones or stronger cruelty/mercilessness, and that from the stones (E) what the rivers bursts/flows from it and that from it (E) what splits/cracks so the water comes out of it, and that from it (E) what drops/reduces from God's fear, andGod (is) not with ignoring/disregarding from what you are doing/making.
Do you covet that they believe to you, and (there) had been a group/party from them (that) was hearing God's speech/conversation (words), then they alter/distort/change it from after what they understood/comprehended it, and they know?
And if they met those who believed, they said: "We believed." And if some of them (were) together to (with) some, they said: "Do you tell/inform them with what God taught on (to) you? To argue with you with it at your Lord." Do you not reason/understand ?
Are they not knowing that God knows what they keep secret and what they declare/publicize ?
And from them (are) illiterates/belonging to a nation they do not know The Book except (as) wishes/desires/lies and that they are except assuming/ supposing.
So grief/distress/woe (expression) to those who write The Book with their hands then they say: "That (it is) from at God." To buy/volunteer with it a small price, so grief/distress/woe (expression) to them from what their hands wrote, and grief/distress/woe (expression) to them from what they gather/acquire.
And they said: "The fire will never touch us except counted/numbered days/times." Say: "Did you take at God a promise/contract, so God will not break His promise/contract, or are you saying on God what you do not know?"
Yes/certainly, who gathered/earned a sin/crime, and his sin/mistake surrounded/enveloped with him so those (are) the fire's owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally.
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, those are the Paradise's owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally.
And when We took Israel's sons' and daughters' promise/covenant, "Do not worship except God, and with the parents a goodness and of the relations/near, and the orphans and the poorest of the poor/poor oppressed, and say to the people goodness, and keep up/take care of the prayers and give/bring the charity/purification." Then you turned away except (a) few from you and you are objecting/opposing.
And when We took your promise/covenant. "Do not shed your blood and do not bring yourselves out from your homes/countries, then you acknowledged/accepted and you (are) witnessing/testifying.
Then you are those who you kill yourselves and you force out a group/part from you, from their homes/countries, you cooperate/support on (against) them with the sin/crime and the transgression/injustice/aggression and if they come to you captives/prisoners you ransom them, and it is forbidden on you bringing/forcing them out. Do you believe with some/part (of) The Book and you disbelieve with some/part? So but (what is the) reward/reimbursement (of) who does that from you, except shame/scandal/disgrace in the life the present/worldly life (on) and the Resurrection Day they be returned to the torture's strongest (severest), and God (is) not with ignoring/disregarding on what you make/do.
Those are these who bought/volunteered the life the present/worldly life with the end (other life), so the torture is not to be lightened/reduced on them, and nor they be given victory.
And We had given/brought Moses The Book and We sent from after him with the messengers, and Wegave/brought Jesus Mary's son, the evidences and We supported him with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit, so if whenever a messenger came to you with what yourselves do not desire you become arrogant, so a group you denied and a group you kill.
And they said: "Our hearts/minds (are) covered/uncomprehending." But God cursed them with their disbelief, so little/few (are) what they believe.
And when a Book came to them from at God, confirming to what (is) with them and they were from before judging/asking on those who disbelieved, so when what they knew came to them, they disbelieved with it, so God's curse/torture (is) on the disbelievers.
How bad (it is what), they bought/volunteered with it themselves, that they disbelieve with what God descended, corrupting/transgressing that God descends from His grace/favour on whom He wants/wills from His worshippers/slaves, so they returned/resided with anger on anger, and to the disbelievers (is) a humiliating torture.
And if it was/is said to them: "Believe with what God descended." They said: "We believe with what is descended on us and they disbelieve with what is behind/beyond it, and it is the truth confirming to what (is) with them." Say: "So why do you kill God's prophets from before, if you were believing?"
And Moses had (E) come to you with the evidences, then you took/received the calf from after him, and you are unjust/oppressive.
And when We took your promise/covenant and We raised the mountain above/over you. Take/receive what We brought (to) you with a strength/power and hear/listen. They said: "We heard and we disobeyed." And they were made to drink/mix/saturate in their hearts/minds the calf with their disbelief. Say: "How bad (is what) your faith/belief orders/commands you with it, if you were believing?"
Say: "If the home (of) the last (other life) was for you, at God clearly/purely (exclusively) from other than the people, so wish/desire the death/lifelessness if you were truthful."
And they will never/not wish/desire it, never, because (of) what their hands advanced, and God (is) knowledgeable with the unjust.
And you will find them (E) the people most holding stingily and desiring strongly on (a) life/existence and from those who shared/made partners with God, any of them wishes/loves if he be granted long life (a) thousand years, and it is not with moving/hurriedly pushing him from the torture, that he be granted long life,and God (is) seeing/understanding with what they make/do/work.
Say: "Who was an enemy to Gabriel, so that he descended it on your heart/mind with God's permission, confirming to what (is) between his hands, and (a) guidance and a good news to the believers."
Who was an enemy to God, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael, so then God (is) an enemy to the disbelievers.
And We had descended to you evidences signs/verses/evidences, and none disbelieves with it except the debauchers.
Is (it) whenever they promised a promise/contract a group of them broke it, but most of them do notbelieve.
And when a messenger came to them from at God confirming to what (is) with them, a group from those who were given The Book, discarded/rejected God's Book behind their backs, as if they do not know.
And they followed what the devils read/recite on Soliman's kingdom/ownership and Soliman did not disbelieve, and but the devils disbelieved. They teach the people the magic/sorcery and what was descended on the two kings/angels Harut and Marutat Babylon, and they (B) do not teach from anyone until they (B) say: "But we are a test, so do not disbelieve". So they learn from them (B) what they separate with it between the human/man and his wife, and they are not with harming with it from anyone except with God's permission. And they learn what harms them and does not benefit them, and they had known for who (E) bought it, (there is) no share of blessing/fortune for him in the end (other life), and how bad (E) (is) what they bought/volunteered with it themselves, if they were knowing?
And if they had believed and feared and obeyed, then a reward (E) from at God, (is) better if they were knowing.
You, you those who believed, do not say: "Observe us." And say: "Give us time And hear/listen, and to the disbelievers (is) a painful torture.
Those who disbelieved from the people of The Book and nor the sharing (with God), they do not wish/love that a goodness be descended on you from your Lord, and God singles out/specializes with His mercy whom He wills/wants, and God (is) of the grace/favour, the great.
We do not erase/nullify/abolish from a sign/verse/evidence, or We make it forgotten, (except that) We come/bring with better than it, or similar/equal/alike to it. Do you not know that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable ?
Do you not know that for God (for) Him (is) the ownership/kingdom (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and (there is) none for you from other than God from (a) guardian and nor (a) victorior.
Or do you want that you question/ask your messenger, as Moses was questioned/asked from before, and who exchanges/replaces/substitutes the disbelief with the belief, so he had misguided the way's/road's straightness/equality.
Many from The Book's people wished/loved if they return you (back) from after your belief (to) disbelievers, envying/jealousy from at themselves from after what was clarified to them (from) the truth, so forgive/pardon and forgive/pardon until God comes with His order/command, that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable.
And keep up the prayers and give the charity/purification and what you advance to yourselves from goodness, you find it at God, that God (is) with what you make/do seeing/understanding.
And they said: "Will never enter the Paradise except who was Jewish or Christian." Those are their wishes/desires. Say: "Give me your proof/evidence if you were truthful."
Yes/certainly, who submitted/surrendered his faith/direction to God and he is (a) good doer, so for him his reward (is) at his Lord and no fear/fright on them and nor they be saddened/grieving.
And the Jews said: "The Christians are not on a thing." And the Christians said: "The Jews are not on a thing." And they read/recite The Book, like that those who do not know said similar (to) their saying so God judges between them (in) the Resurrection Day, in what they were in it differing/disagreeing.
And who is more unjust/oppressive from (than) who prevented (in) God's mosques that His name be mentioned/remembered in it, and strived/hastened in its destruction/spoilage. Those, it was not for them that they enter it except afraid/frightened. For them in the present world (is) shame/disgrace and for them in the end (other life) (is a) great torture.
And to God the sunrise/east and the sunset/west, so wherever you turn, so there (is) God's face/direction, that God is rich/extended, knowledgeable.
And they said: "God took/received a child (son) His praise/glory, but to Him what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, each/all for him (are) obeying humbly.
Creating marvelously without precedent the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and if He ordered/accomplished a matter/affair, so but he says to it: "Be." So it will become.
And those who do not know said: "If only God converses/speaks (to) us or a sign/verse/evidence comes to us." Like that those from before them said alike/similar/equal (to) their saying. Their hearts/minds resembled (each other), We had clarified/explained the signs/verses/evidences to a nation being sure/certain.
That We sent you with the truth (as) an announcer of good news and a warner/giver of notice, and you are not (to) be asked/questioned about the roaring fire's/Hell's owners/company.
And the Jews and nor the Christians will not/never accept/approve about you until you follow their religion/faith. Say: "That God's guidance, it is the guidance." And if (E) you followed their self attractions for desires after what came to you from the knowledge, (there is) none for you from (other than) God from a guardian and nor (a) victorior.
Those who We brought to them The Book they read/recite it its correct/true reading/recitation, those believe with it and who disbelieves with it so those (are) the losers.
You Israel's sons and daughters, remember My blessing, that I blessed on you, and that I preferred/favoured you over the creations all together/(universes).
And fear a day/time, no self rewards/reimburses (removes) from a self a thing, and no redemption/ransom (is) to be accepted/received from it, and nor mediation benefits it, and nor they be given victory/aid.
And when Abraham's Lord tested (him) with words/expressions, so He completed them, (He) said: "That I am making you to the people a leader/example." He (Abraham) said: "And from my descendants?" He said: "The unjust/oppressors do not receive/obtain My promise."
And when We put The House (as) a reward/replacement/compensation to the people, and (a) safety/security, and they took from Abraham's place a prayer place, and We entrusted/recommended to Abraham and Ishmael: "That purify/clean/wash (B) My House for the circlers/walkers around, and the devoting/dedicating, and the bowing, the prostrating."
And when Abraham said: "My Lord, make this a safe/secure country/place, and provide for its people from the fruits, who believed from them, by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day." He said: "And who disbelieved, so I give him long life/make him enjoy a little, then I force him to the fire's torture, and how bad (is) the end/destination."
And when Abraham raises the foundations/bases from The House, and Ishmael: "Our Lord accept from us, that you are the hearing/listening the knowledgeable."
Our Lord and make us two Moslems to you, and from our descendants, a nation submitting/surrendering/Moslems to you, and show us our rituals/methods of worship and forgive on us, that you are the forgiver, the most merciful.
Our Lord, and send in them a messenger from them (who) reads/recites on (to) them Your verses/evidences and He teaches/instructs them The Book, and the wisdom, and purifies them, that You are the glorious/mighty the wise/ judicious.
And who shuns/turns away from Abraham's religion/faith except who made himself ignorant/foolish ?And We had chosen/purified him in the present world, and that he is in the end (other life) from (E) the correct/righteous.
When his Lord said to him: "Submit/surrender/be Moslem." He said: "I submitted/surrendered/became Moslem to the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
And Abraham directed/commanded with it his sons and daughters, and Jacob: "You my sons and daughters, that God chose/purified for you the religion, so do not die (E) except and you are submitters/surrenderers/Moslems."
Or were you witnesses when the death came to Jacob, when he said to his sons and daughters :"What (do) you worship from after me?" They said: "We worship your God and your fathers/forefathers Abraham's and Ishmael's and Issac's God, one God and we are to Him submitters/surrenderers/Moslems."
That is a nation had past for it what it earned/acquired and for you what you earned/acquired and you are not to (be) asked/questioned about what they were doing/making.
And they said: "Be Jews or Christians, you will be guided." Say: "But Abraham's religion/faith submitter/unifier of God, and he was not from the sharers (with God)."
Say: "We believed with God and what was descended to us and what was descended to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/branches/Jewish tribes, and what was given to Moses, and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Lord, we do not separate/distinguish between anyone from them, and we are to Him submitters/surrenderers/Moslems."
So if they believed with a similar/equal/alike (to) what you believed with (it), so they had been guided, and if they turned away, so but they are in defiance/disobedience, so God will suffice (protect) you against them, and He (is) the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
God's faith/immersion, and who (is) better than God's faith/immersion, and we are to Him worshipping.
Say: "Do you argue with us in God, and He is our Lord and your Lord, and for us (are) our deeds,and for you your deeds, and we are for Him faithful/loyal ?"
Or (do) you say that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/branches/Jewish tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: "Are you more knowing or God? And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who hid/concealed a testimony at (with) him (self) from God, and God is not ignoring about what you make/do."
That (is) a nation had passed/expired for it what it earned/acquired, and for you what you earned/acquired, and you are not (to) be asked/questioned about what they were making/doing.

The angels carry it. That in that (is a) sign/evidence (E) to you if you were believing.
So when Saul/Taloot separated/parted with the soldiers/warriors, he said: "That God (is) testing you with a river/waterway, so who drank from it, so he is not from me, and who did not taste it, so he is from me, except who scooped a scoop, with his hand." So they drank from it, except a few from them, so when he crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: "No power/ability/energy to us today with Goliath and his soldiers/warriors." Those who assume/suppose that they are meeting God said: "How many (times) from a little/small group defeated a group (of) many with God's will?" And God (is) with the patient/enduring.
And when they emerged/appeared to Goliath and his soldiers/warriors, they said: "Our Lord, pour on us patience and make our feet firm, and give us victory/aid on (over) the nation, the disbelieving."
So they defeated them with God's will, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him the ownership/kingdom and the wisdom and He taught/instructed him from what He wills/wants, and (if it) was not for God's pushing the people, some/part of them with some/part (with each other), the earth/Planet Earth would have been corrupted/disordered, and but God (is owner) of grace/favour/blessing over the creations altogether/(universes).
Those are God's signs/verses/evidences, We read/recite it on (to) you with the truth, and that you are from the messengers.
Those are the messengers, We preferred/favoured/blessed some/part of them over some/part, from them who spoke/conversed/talked (with) God, and He rose some/part of them steps/stages/degrees. And We gave Jesus,Mary's son, the evidences, and We supported him with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit, and if God wanted/willed, those from after them would not (have) fought/killed each other from after the evidences came to them, and but they differed/disagreed/disputed, so from them who believed, and from them who disbelieved, and if God willed/wanted, they would not (have) fought/killed each other, and but God does/makes what Hewants/wills/intends.
You, you those who believed, spend from what We provided for you from before that a day comes, (there is) no selling/trading in it and nor faithful/close friendship, and nor mediation, and the disbelievers, they are the unjust/oppressive.
God, no God except He, the live/alive, the of no beginning and self sufficient, no drowsiness/slumber,and nor sleep takes Him, for Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth. Who (is) that who mediates at Him, except with His permission ? He knows what (is) between their hands and what (is) behind them, and they do not comprehend/envelope with a thing from His knowledge, except with what He wills/wants. His throne/knowledge extended/contained/enriched the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and (it) does not tire/burden Him their (B)'s protection/observation, and He (is) the high/dignified, the great.
No compulsion/force in the religion, the correct/right had been clarified, from the misguidance/failure, so who disbelieves with the devil/every thing worshipped other than God and believes with God, so he had held fast/clung to with the tie/handle, the tight/affirmed, no breaking/cutting to it, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
God (is) guardian/patron (of) those who believed, He brings them out from the darknesses to the light, and those who disbelieved, their guardian/patron (is) the devil/every thing worshipped other than God they bring them out from the light to the darknesses, those are the fire's owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally.
Did you not see/understand to who quarreled/argued/disputed (with) Abraham in his Lord, that God gave him the ownership/kingdom, when Abraham said: "My Lord, (is) who revives/makes alive and makes die." He said: "I revive/make alive and I make die." Abraham said: "So then God comes with the sun from the east, so come with it from the west." So who disbelieved was astonished/confused, and God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive.
Or like who passed on (by a) village/urban city and it is destroyed/empty on its ceilings/structures.He Said: "How God revives/makes alive this, after its death/ lifelessness?" So God made him die one hundred years, then He revived/resurrected him. He said: "How many/much did you stay/wait/remain?" He said: "I stayed/waited/remained a day or some/part (of) a day." He said: "Yes/but, you stayed/waited/remained one hundred years, so look to your food and your drink, (it) did not change/rot, and look to your donkey and to make/put/manipulate you (E) (as) a sign/evidence to the people, and look to the bones, how We raise and assemble it over each other then We dress/clothe (cover it with) flesh/meat." So when (it) was clarified/explained to him, he said: "I know that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable."
And when Abraham said: "My Lord, show me how you revive/make alive the deads." He said: "Did you not believe?" he said: "Yes/certainly, and but (for) my heart/mind to (be) assured/secure (E)." He (Abraham) said: "So take four from the birds, so take them (F) close to you, then put on every mountain from them (F) a part/portion, then call them (F), they come (F) (to) you fast, and know that God isglorious/mighty/powerful/dignified, wise/judicious."

And (the) example/proverb of those who spend their properties/wealths asking/wishing/ desiring God's acceptances/satisfactions, and steadfastness/affirmation from themselves, (is) as (an) example/proverb (of) a treed garden with an elevated ground/hill, a heavy rain struck it, so it brought/gave its fruits two doubles, so if no strong rain struck it, so light rain/drizzle, and God (is) with what you make/do seeing/knowing.

Their guidance (is) not on you, and but God guides whom he wills/wants, and what you spend from goodness/wealth, so it is for yourselves, and you do not spend, except asking/desiring God's face/direction, and what you spend from goodness/wealth is fulfilled/completed to you, and you are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
For the poor, those who were restricted/surrounded in God's way/sake, they are not able (to go) moving/traveling in the earth/Planet Earth, the ignorant/foolish thinks/supposes them (as) rich from the purity/refrainment (dignity), you know them by their expressions/marks, they do not ask/question the people persistently, and what you spend from goodness/wealth, so that God (is) with it knowledgeable.

Those who eat the growth/interest/usury, they do not stand/keep up except as (that who) stands/keeps up who the devil strikes/touches him from the madness, that (is) because they (E) said: "But the selling/trading (is) equal/similar/alike (to) the growth/interest/usury, and God permitted/allowed the selling/trading and forbade the growth/interest/usury." So who came to him (got) a warning/advice from his Lord, so he ended/stopped, so for him what preceded/past, and his matter/affair (is) to God, and who returned, so those are the fire's owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally.
