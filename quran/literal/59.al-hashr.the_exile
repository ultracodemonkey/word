Praised/glorified to God what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious.
He is who brought out those who disbelieved from The Book's people from their homes/countries to the gathering's beginning, you did not think/assume that (E) they emerge, and they thought/assumed, that they, their fortresses/fortification are protecting them/making them invincible from God, so God came to them from where/when they did not think/suppose, and He threw/hurled in their hearts/minds the terror/fright, they destroy/demolish their houses/homes with their hands, and the believers' hands, so be warned/cautioned, you (owners) of the eye sights/knowledge.
Where it not for that (E) God wrote/decreed the departure/moving out on them, He would have tortured them in the present world, and for them in the end (other life is) the fire's torture.
That (is) with that they defied/disobeyed God and His messenger, and who defies/disobeys God, so then God (is) strong (severe) in the punishment.
What you cut off from a palm, or you left it standing on its roots, so (it is) with God's permission/pardon, and to reimburse the debauchers.
And what God bestowed upon/gave spoils of war on His messenger from them, so you did not hurry/rush on him from horses, and nor camels ridden or loaded/riders, and but God empowers His messengers on whom He wills/wants, and God is on every thing capable. (Whatever God gave His messenger is not from your support but through God's blessing.)
What God bestowed upon/gave spoils of war on His messenger from the villages'/urban cities' people, so (it is) to God and the messenger, and to of the relations/near, and the orphans, and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the traveler/stranded traveler, in order that (it) not be a rotation/alternation between the rich from you, and what the messenger gave you, so take/receive it, and what he forbid/prevented you from it, so terminate/stop, and fear and obey God, so that truly God (is) strong (severe in) the punishment.
To the poorest of poor/poor oppressed the emigrants those who were brought out/driven out from their houses/homes and their properties/possessions, they wish/desire grace/favour from God, and an acceptance/approval, and they give victory/aid (to) God and His messenger, those, they are the truthful.
And those who resided/settled the house/home and the faith/belief from before them, they love/like who emigrated to them, and they do not find in their chests (innermosts) a need/necessity from what they were given/brought, and they prefer/choose (the immigrants) over themselves and even if (it) was neediness/poverty with them, and who is protected (from) his self', so those are the successful/winners.
And those who came from after them, they say: "Our Lord forgive for us, and to our brothers, those who preceded us with (to) the faith/belief, and do not make/put in our hearts/minds hatred/animosity to those who believed, our Lord, that you are merciful/compassionate, merciful."
Did you not see to those who exercised hypocrisy, they say to their brothers those who disbelieved from The Books' people: "If (E) you were brought out, we will go out (E) with you. And we do not obey anyone in (from) you ever (E), and if you were fought/killed, We will give you victory/aid (E)." And God witnesses/testifies that they truly are liars/deniers/falsifiers (E).
If (E) they were brought/driven out, they do not get out with them, and if (E) they were fought/killed, they do not give them victory/aid, and if (E) they gave them victory/aid, they will turn away (E) (on) the backs/ends, then, they do not be given victory/aid.
You are (E) stronger terror/fright in their chests (innermosts) than God, that (is) with that they (are) a nation not understanding/knowing.
They do not fight/kill you all/all together, except in fortified/protected villages/urban cities, or from behind walls, their courage/power between them (is) strong (severe), you think/suppose them (to be) all/all together, and their hearts/minds (are) separate/different, that (is) with that they are a nation not reasoning/comprehending.
As/like (the) example/proverb, (of) those from before them near/close (shortly), they tasted/experienced their matters'/affair's severity/bad consequences, and for them (is) a painful torture.
As/like (the) example/proverb (of) the devil, when he said to the human/mankind: "Disbelieve." So when he (the human) disbelieved, he said: "I am innocent/renouncing from you, that I, I fear God, the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
So their (B)'s end (result) was that they (B) (are) in the fire immortally/eternally in it, and that (is) the unjust's/oppressive's reimbursement.
You, you those who believed, fear and obey God, and a self should watch/consider what it advanced/presented for tomorrow/(the) future, and fear and obey God, that truly God (is) expert/experienced, with what you make/do.
And do not be as/like those who forgot God, so He made them forget themselves, those, they are the debauchers.
The fire's owners/company/friends and the treed garden's/paradise's owners/company/friends, do not become equal/alike, the treed garden's/paradise's owners/company/friends, they are the successful/triumphant.
If We descended this the Koran on (a) mountain you would have seen/understood it humble/submissive splitting/cracking from God's fear, and those are the examples/proverbs We give it for the people, maybe/perhaps they think.
He is God, He whom (there is) no God except Him, knower (of) the unseen/invisible/ supernatural and the testimony/presence, He is the merciful, the most merciful.412
He is God, which (there is) no God except Him, the king/owner/possessor, the holy/sanctimonious/ glorified, the safety/security/peace, the confirmer/believer, the guardian/protector, the glorious/mighty, the almighty/tremendous, the greatened/proud/arrogant, God's praise/glory from what they share/make partners (with Him).
He is God, the creator, the creator, the shaper/former/image maker, for Him (are) the names the good/most beautiful, what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, praise/glorify to Him, and He is the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious.413
