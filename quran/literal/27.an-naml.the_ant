Guidance and good news to the believers.
Those who keep up the prayers and give/bring the charity/purification, and they are with the end (other life), they are sure/certain.
That those who do not believe with the end (other life), We decorated/beautified for them their deeds, so they are being confused/puzzled.

When/if Moses said to his family/relation : "That I, I perceived/saw a fire, I will come to you from it with a news/information, or I come to you with a flame flame/torch, maybe/perhaps you warm (yourselves)".
So when he came to it, (it) was called: "That is/was blessed who is in the fire/mark and who (is) around/surrounding it, and God's praise/glory (is) to the nations all together's/(universe's) Lord.
You Moses, that it truly is I, God, the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious.
And throw/throw away your stick/cane, so when he saw it, it shakes/moves as if it is a Jinn he turned away giving his back, and he did not follow/succeed/track: "You Moses, do not fear, that I, the messengers do not fear at/by/near Me."
Except who caused injustice/oppression then exchanged/replaced good after bad/evil/harm, so I am forgiving, merciful.
And enter your hand in your collar/opening it appears/emerges white from without bad/evil/harm, in nine evidences/signs to Pharaoh and his nation, that they truly were a nation (of) debauchers.
So when Our signs/evidences came to them manifest/clearly visible to the eye and understanding, they said: "That (is) clear/evident magic/sorcery."
And they disbelieved and denied with it, and their selves became sure/certain of it, unjustly/oppressively and height, might and dignity, so look/see how was the corruptings' end/turn (result).
And We had (E) given David and Soliman knowledge, and they (B) said: "The praise/gratitude (is) to God who preferred/favoured us over many from His slaves/worshippers, the believers."
And Soliman inherited David, and he said: "You, you the people we had been taught the birds' speech (language)/logic, and we were given from every thing, that truly that it is (E) the grace/favour/blessing, the clear/evident."
And was gathered for Soliman his soldiers/warriors from the Jinns and the human/mankind, and the birds, so they are being restrained/apportioned (mobilized).
Until when they passed by the ants' valley, an ant said: "You, you the ants, enter your residences, (let) not Soliman and his warriors smash/destroy you (E) and they are not feeling/sensing
So he smiled laughing/wondering from its saying/word, and he said: "My Lord, inspire/influence me that I thank/be grateful (for) your blessing which you blessed on me and on my parents, and that I make/do correct/righteous deeds You accept/approve it, and enter me with Your mercy in (between) Your worshippers/slaves the correct/righteous."
And he seeked/searched the bird/birds, so he said: "Why (it is) not for me, I do not see the hoopoe bird/clucking bird, or he was from the absent? I will torture him strong (severe) torture."
I will slaughter it (E), or it comes/brings to me (E) with a proof/evidence clear/evident.

I found her and her nation prostrating to the sun, from other than God, and the devil decorated/beautified for them their deeds, so he prevented/obstructed them from the way/path, so they do not be guided.
Do they not prostrate to God who brings out the hidden/concealed in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and he knows what you hide, and what you declare/publicize ?
God, no God except Him, Lord (of) the throne, the great.

She said: "You, you the nobles/assembly, that I, was/is thrown to me (an) honoured/generous Book."
That it truly is from Soliman, and that it truly is by God's name the merciful, the most merciful.
That do not become high, mighty and dignified over me, and come to me (as) Moslems/submitters.
She said: "You, you the nobles/assembly, give me your opinion in my matter/affair/order/command, I was not deciding a matter/affair/order/command until you witness/testify."
They said: "We are (owners) of power/strength, and (owners) of strong (severe) courage/might/power, and the matter/affair/order/command (is) to you, so think about what you order/command."
She said: "That truly the kings if they entered a village/urban city they corrupted it and they made/put its more dignified/honoured people, humiliated/disgraced, and as/like that they make/do."

A wicked/manipulator from the Jinns said: "I come/bring to you with it before that you stand/get up from your place/position, and that I am on it powerful/strong (E), faithful/loyal."
Who (is) at him knowledge from The Book said: "I come/bring to you with it before that your eye lid returns to you (you blink)." So when he saw it established/affixed at him, he said: "This (is) from my Lord's grace/favour/blessing, to test me do I thank/be grateful, or I disbelieve, and who thanked/became grateful, so but he thanks/becomes grateful for his self, and who disbelieved, so then my Lord (is) rich, honoured/generous."
He said: "Change/disguise for her, her throne, we see is she to be guided or she becomes from those who do not be guided."
So when she came, (it) was said: "Is your throne like this?" She said: "As if it, it is." And we were given the knowledge from before her, and we were Moslems/submitters..
And what she was worshipping from other than God obstructed/prevented her, that she truly was from a disbelieving nation.
(It) was said to her: "Enter the palace/tower." So when she saw it, she thought/supposed it (was) a wide body of water, and she removed/uncovered from her two shins/legs, he said: "That it truly is a palace/tower smoothened and spread from clear glass/mirrors." She said: "My Lord, that I caused injustice/oppression (to) myself, and I submitted/surrendered with Soliman, to God, the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
And We had sent to Thamud their brother Saleh : "That worship God, so then they are two groups/parties disputing/controverting.
He said: "You my nation, why (do) you hasten/urge with the sin/crime before the good/goodness? If only you ask God for forgiveness, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy."
They said: "We had a bad omen with you (you are a bad omen to us), and with whom (is) with you." He said: "Your omen (fate/future is) at God, but you are a nation being tested/misguided."

And they schemed, a scheme and We schemed a scheme, and (while) they are not feeling/knowing/sensing.
So look/see/wonder about how was their scheme's end/turn (result), that We (E), We destroyed them, and their nation all/all together.269

Are you that you are coming/doing/committing (E) the men (with) a lust/desire/craving from other than the women, but you are a nation being lowly/ignorant.
So his nation's answer/reply was not except that they said: "Bring/drive out Lot's family from your village/urban city, that they are people purifying."
So We saved/rescued him and his family/people, except his woman (wife), We predestined her from the remaining behind.
And We rained on them rain, so the warned's/given notice's rain was bad/evil/harmful.

Or Who guides you in the shore's/land's and the sea's/ocean's darknesses, and Who sends the winds/breezes (as) a good news, between His mercy's hand. Is a god with God? God (is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified from/on what they share/make partners (with Him).

Until when they came, and He said: "Did you lie/deny/falsify with My verses/evidences/signs, and you did not comprehend/encircle with it knowledge, (or) what that you were making/doing."
And the saying/word fell/landed on (to) them with/because (of) what they caused injustice/oppression, so they do not speak.
