When/if the earth/Planet Earth shook/trembled its shaking/trembling/earthquake.
And the earth/Planet Earth brought out its loads/weights.
And the human/mankind said: "What (is) for it (what is wrong with it)?"
That day it tells/informs (about) its news/information/knowledge.
With that your Lord inspired/transmitted to it.
That day, the people proceed/arise separately to see their deeds.
So who makes/does a smallest particle of anything (smaller than an atom's) weight (of) good sees it.
And who makes/does a smallest particle of anything (smaller than an atom's) weight (of) bad/evil sees it.475
