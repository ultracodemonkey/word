That God does not cause injustice/oppress a weight/smallest particle, and if (it) be a goodness, He doubles it, and gives from at Him a great reward.54
So how if We came from every nation/generation with an honest witness and We came with you (S/M) on those a witness?
That day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger if the earth/Planet Earth be straightened with them, and they do not hide/conceal (from) God an information/speech.
You, you those who believed, do not approach the prayers and you are intoxicated, until you know what you are saying, and nor distant from God/impure, except crossing a road/way, until you wash yourselves with water, and if you were sick/diseased or on a long distance travel, or any of you came from the safe and hidden depression in ground used for human discharge (toilet) or you touched repeatedly/touched and felt repeatedly (could mean: had intercourse with) the women, so you did not find water, so wipe your hands and face with dust, pure/good dust, so wipe with your faces and your hands, that God was/is often forgiving/pardoning, forgiving.
Did you not see to those who were given a share from The Book, they buy/volunteer the misguidance and they want that you (also) be misguided (from) the way?
And God (is) more knowing with (about) your enemies, and enough/sufficient with God (as) a guardian and enough/sufficient with God (as) a victorior/savior.
From those who repented/guided/Jews, they alter the words/expressions from its places, and they say: "We heard/listened and we disobeyed." And hear/listen not making others hear, and: "Observe us."Distortion with their tongues/languages and defaming in the religion, and if that they said: "We heard/listened and we obeyed and hear/listen and give us time/delay us." (It) would have been best for them and more just/direct, and but God cursed them, with their disbelief, so they do not believe, except (for a) few. (NOTE: IN HEBREW MEANS `OUR EVIL ONE'),
You, you those who were given The Book, believe with what We descended, confirming to what (is) with you (P) from before that We efface/wipe out faces, so We return it on its backs or We curse/humiliate them as We cursed/humiliated the owners of the Saturday/Sabbath, and God's order/command is/was done.
That God does not forgive that to be shared with Him, and He forgives what (is) other than that, to who He wills/wants, and who shares with God, so he fabricated a great sin/crime.
Did you not see to those who purify themselves, but God purifies/corrects who He wills/wants, and they are not being caused injustice to, (as little as) a cleft in a seed/twine.
See how they are fabricating on God the lies/falsehood, and enough with it, (as an) evident sin/crime
Did you not see to those who were given a share from The Book, they believe with the idol/sorcery/sorcerer and the anything worshipped other than God/the devil, and they say to those who disbelieved: "Those (are) more guided from those who believed (by) a way/path."
Those, are those who God cursed/humiliated them, and whom God humiliates, so you will never find for him a victoriors/savior.
Or for them (is) a share from the ownership/kingdom, so then they do not give the people (as little as) a peck in a seed/stone.55
Or do they envy the people with jealousy on what God gave them, from His grace/favour/blessing, so We had given Abraham's family The Book, and the wisdom, and We gave them a great ownership/kingdom.
So from them who believed with (in) Him, and from them who prevented/obstructed from Him, and enough with Hell blazing.
That those who disbelieved, with Our verses, We will roast them (in) a fire, whenever their skins were done/cooked (burnt), We replaced/substituted them (with) skins other than it, to taste/experience the torture, that God was/is glorious/mighty, wise/judicious.
And those who believed and did/made the correct/righteous deeds, We will enter them treed gardens, the rivers flow from beneath it, (they are) immortally/eternally in it, for them in it (are) purified spouses, and We enter them (in) shade, continuous/permanent shade.
That God, orders/commands you that you discharge/fulfill the deposits/securities to its people (owners), and if you judged/ruled between the people, that you judge/rule with the justice/equality, that God (is) blessed/praised, He preaches/advises/warns you with (about) Him, that God was/is hearing/listening, seeing/knowing/understanding.
You, you those who believed, obey God and obey the messenger, and (those) of the order/command from you, so if you disputed in a thing, so return it to God and the messenger, if you were believing with God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, that is better and (the) best interpretation/explanation.
Did you not see to those who claim that they believed with what was descended to you (S/M), and what was descended from before you, they want that to be judged to the anything worshipped other than God/the devil, and they were ordered/commanded that to disbelieve with it, and the devil wants that to misguide them, (a) far/distant misguidance.
And if (it) was said to them: "Come to what God descended and to the messenger." You saw the hypocrites preventing/obstructing from you preventfully/obstructively.
So how if a disaster struck them with what their hands advanced/presented/undertook, then they came to you swearing by God: "That truly we wanted except a goodness, and harmony."
Those are, those who God knows what (is) in their hearts/minds, so object/oppose from them, and preach/advise/warn them, and say to them in themselves an eloquent/sufficient saying.
And We did not sent from a messenger except to be obeyed with God's permission; and if that when they caused injustice/oppression to themselves, they came to you, so they asked for forgiveness (from) God, and the messenger asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found God forgiving, merciful.
So no, and by your Lord, they do not believe, until they appoint you to judge in what quarreled/disputed between them, then they do not find in themselves a strain/blame from what you judged/ordered,and they submit/surrender submissively/surrenderingly.
And if that We wrote/ordered/decreed on them, that kill yourselves or get out from your homes, they would not have done it, except (a) few from them, and if that they did what they are being advised/warned with it (it) would have been best for them, and strongest affirmation.56
And then We would have given them from at Us a great reward.
And We would have guided them a straight/direct road/way.
And who obeys God and the messenger, so these (are) with those who God blessed on them from the prophets and the always very truthful, and the witnessing/those killed in God's sake, and the correct/righteous, and those are a good helper/supporter/companion/friend.
That (is) the grace/blessing from God, and enough/sufficient with God knowledgeable.
You, you those who believed, take your caution/fear, so rush/hasten (in) groups, or rush/hasten all together.
And that from you who (E) will slow/delay/linger (E), so if a disaster struck you, he said: "God had blessed on me, when I was not present with them."
And if (E) grace/blessing from God struck you, he will say (E) as if love/affection/friendship was not between you (P), and between him: "Oh, if only I were with them, so I succeed/win a great success/winning/triumph."
So those who volunteer the present world/worldly life with the end (other life) should fight/kill in God's sake, and who fights/kills in God's sake, so he is killed or he defeats/conquers, so We will give him a great reward.
And for what (why) do you not fight/kill in God's sake? And the weakened from the men and the women, and the children/newborns, those who say: "Our Lord, bring us out from this the village/urban city, the unjust/oppressive (to) its people, and make for us from at You a guardian/victorior/ally, and make for us from at You a savior/supporter."
Those who believed, fight/kill in God's sake, and those who disbelieved fight/kill in the devil/idol's sake, so fight/kill the devil's supporters/allies/followers, that the devil's conspiracy/deceit was weak.
Did you not see to those who were said to them: "Prevent/stop your hands and keep up the prayers, and give the charity." So when the fighting/killing was written/decreed on them, then a group from them fear the people, as God's fear, or stronger fear, and they said: "Our Lord, for what (did) You write/decree on us the fighting/killing, if only You delayed us to (a) near term/time." Say: "The present world's enjoyment (is) little, and the end (other life) (is) best to who feared and obeyed, and you do (will) not be caused injustice to/oppressed (as little as) a cleft in a seed."
Wherever you are, the death catches up/reaches you, and (even) if you were in towers/castles/constellations built/erected, and if a goodness strikes them, they say: "This (is) from at God." And if a sin/crime (harm) strikes them, they say: "This (is) from at you." Say: "All/each (are) from at God, so how those the nation, they almost do not understand an information/speech?"
What struck you from a goodness, so (it is) from at God, and what struck you from a sin/crime (harm) so (it is) from your self, and We sent you to the people, (as) a messenger and enough with God, (as) a witness/present.57
And who obeys the messenger, so he obeyed God, and who turned away, so We did not send you on them (as) a protector.
And they say: "Obedience." So if they emerged from at you, a group from them schemed at night other than what you say, and God writes what they scheme at night, so oppose/turn away from them and rely/depend on God, and enough with God (as) a guardian/protector.
So do they not consider The Koran, and if (it) were from at other than God, they would have found in it much difference/disagreement.
And if a matter/affair from the safety/security or the fear came to them, they spread/circulated with it, and if they returned it to the messenger and to (those) of the order/command from them; those who from them conclude/discover (understand) it would have known it (E), and where it not for God's grace/favour/blessing on you, and His mercy, you would have followed the devil, except a few (from you).
So fight/kill in God's sake, you are not burdened/imposed upon except (with) your self, and instigate/urge/encourage the believers, maybe that God prevents/stops those who disbelieved's might/power, and God (is) stronger power/might, and stronger severe exemplary punishment.
Who mediates a good mediation, for him is a share from it, and who mediates a bad/evil mediation, for him is a share from it, and God was/is on every thing providing.
And if you were greeted with a greeting, so greet with better from (than) it, or return it, that God was/is on every thing counting/calculating.
God, no God except He/Him, He will gather/collect you (E) to the Resurrection Day, no doubt/suspicion in it; and who (is) more truthful from (than) God (in) an information/speech?
So what for you (so why are you being divided) two groups in (regarding) the hypocrites? And God set them back because (of) what they gathered, do you want that to guide who God misguided? And who God misguides, so you will not find for him a path/means.
They wished/loved if you disbelieve, as they disbelieved, so you become equal/alike. So do not take from them allies, until they emigrate in God's sake, so if they turned away, so take/punish them and fight/kill them, where/when you found them, and do not take from them an ally, and nor a supporter/savior.
Except those who reach to (a) nation between you and between them (is) a) covenant (treaty), or they came to you, their chests (are) restricted/depressed, that they fight/kill you, or they fight/kill their nation, and if God wanted/willed, He would have empowered them on you, so they would have fought/killed you (P), so if they separated/isolated themselves from you, so they did not fight/kill you, and they threw (offered) to you the peace/surrender, so God did not make for you on them a path/means.
You will find others, they want that they (be) secured by you (have peace with you), and they be trusted/secured (by) their nation, whenever they are returned to the treason, they were made to be set back/replaced in it, so if they did not separate/ isolate/withdraw themselves from you, and they (did not) throw (offer) to you the peace/surrender, and (nor) they stop their hands, so take them and58fight/kill them where/when you defeated them/caught up with them, and those, We made for you on them a clear/evident power.
And (it) was/is not to a believer that he kills a believer except mistakenly, and who killed a believer mistakenly, so freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), and compensation handed over/delivered to his (the victim's) family, except that they give charity (forgive), so if he was from a nation, an enemy for you, and he (the victim was) a believer, so freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), and if he was/is from a nation between you and between them (is) a covenant (treaty), so a compensation handed over/delivered to his (the victim's) family and freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), so who does not find, so fasting two months following each other (E), a repentance from at God, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And who kills a believer intentionally/purposely, so his reward (repayment/retribution is) Hell immortally/eternally in it, and God became angry on him, and He cursed/humiliated him, and He prepared for him a great torture.
You, you those who believed, if you moved in God's sake, so seek clarification/explanation, and do not say to who threw (offered) the peace/surrender/greeting, you are not a believer, you wish/desire the life the present's/worldly life's enjoyable accessories, so at God (are) many winnings/gains/spoils, like that you were from before, so God blessed on you, so seek clarification/explanation, that God was/is with what you make/do expert/experienced.
From the believers the remaining (behind) not/other than those of the difficult circumstances and the struggling/defending for God's sake with their properties and themselves do not become equal, God preferred the struggling/defending with their properties and themselves over the remaining in a stage/degree, and each/all God promised the goodness, and God preferred the struggling/defending above the remaining (by) a great reward.
Stages/degrees from Him and a forgiveness and a mercy, and God was/is a forgiver, merciful.
That those the angels make them die, unjust (to) themselves, they said: "In what you were/have been?" They said: "We were weakened in the Earth/land." They said: "Was not God's Earth/land wide/spacious so you emigrate in it." So those, their shelter/refuge (is) Hell, and it was a bad/evil end/destination.
Except the weakened from the men, and the women, and the children, they are not able (of a) solution (means) and nor they be guided a way/path.
So those, maybe God that He forgives/pardons on them, and God was/is often forgiving, (a) forgiver.
And who emigrates in God's sake, he finds in the earth an escape, and a wealth/an abundance, and who gets out from his house emigrating to God and His messenger, then the death overtakes him, so his reward had fallen/been placed on God, and God was/is a forgiver, merciful.
And if you (P) moved in the Earth/land, so offense/guilt is not on you, that you shorten/reduce from the prayers if you feared that those who disbelieved betray/torture you, that the disbelievers are/were to you an evident, an enemy. (NOTE: THE CONDITION FOR REDUCTION OR SHORTENING OF PRAYERS DURING TRAVEL IN THE PRECEDING VERSE)59
And if you were in them, so you started for them the prayer, so a group from them should stand with you, and they should take their weapons/arms, so if they prostrated, so they be from behind you, and another group should come (that) they did not pray, so they pray (E) with you, and they should take their caution, and their weapons/arms; those who disbelieved, wished if you ignore/neglect your weapons/arms, and your belongings/effects/goods, so they lean on you one bend, and no offense/guilt (is) on you if mild harm was with you from rain or you were sick/diseased, that you lay your weapons/arms, and take your caution, that God prepared to the disbelievers a degrading/humiliating torture.
So if you (P) accomplished the prayers, so mention/remember God standing, and sitting, and on your sides, so if you became secured, so keep up the prayers, that the prayers was/is on the believers decreed (at) appointed times. (NOTE: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PRAYERS, ITS TIMES, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REPEATEDLY MENTIONING GOD THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN THE PRECEDING VERSE)
And do not weaken in asking/desiring the nation, if you are feeling pain, so then they are feeling pain, as/like you feel pain/ache, and you hope/expect from God what they do not hope/expect, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
That We have descended to you The Book with the truth to judge/rule between the people with what God showed you, and do not be to the betrayers an arguer.
And ask for God's forgiveness, that God was/is a forgiver, merciful.
And do not argue/dispute about those who betray themselves, that God does not love/like who was/is often betraying/often being unfaithful, a sinner, a criminal.
They hide from the people and they do not hide from God, and He is with them when they scheme at night what He does not accept/approve from the saying, and God was/is with what they do surrounding/enveloping.
Here you are those (who) argued/disputed about them in the life the present/worldly life; so who argues/disputes (with) God about them (in) the Resurrection Day, or who will be on them a guardian/protector ?
And who does bad/evil/harm or causes injustice (to) himself then he asks for forgiveness (from) God, he finds God a forgiver, merciful.
And who acquires/carries a sin/crime, so but he carries it on himself, and God was/is wise/judicious.
And who acquires/carries a sin or a sin/crime, then he blames and accuses an innocent, so he had carried wrongfully/slanderfully and an evident sin/crime.
And where it not for God's grace/favour/blessing on you and His mercy, a group from them resolved/started (E) that (to) misguide you, and they do not misguide except themselves, and they do not harm you from a thing, and God descended on you The Book and the wisdom, and He taught you, what you did (and) were not to know, and God's grace/favour on you was/is great.60

And who makes/does from the correct/righteous deeds from a male or a female, and he is believing, so those enter the Paradise, and they are not being caused injustice/oppression to (in the amount of) a peck in a seed/stone.

And (He) had descended on you in The Book, that if you heard God's verses/signs/evidences being disbelieved with it, and being mocked with it, so do not sit/remain with them until they plunge into in an information/speech other than it, that you are then similar/equal to them, that God (is) gathering/collecting the hypocrites and the disbelievers in Hell all together.
Those who wait/remain with you, so if a victory/opening happened for you from God, they (the hypocrites) said: "Where we not with you?" And if to the disbelievers was a luck/fortune, they (the hypocrites) said: "Did we not dominate/drive fast/defeat on (with) you and protect you from the believers?"

The Book's people ask/question you, that to descend on them a book from the sky/space, so they had asked Moses greater than that, so they said: "Show us God publicly/openly." So the fire falling from the sky accompanied by thunderous noise punished/took them with their injustice/oppression, then they took the calf from after what came to them (from) the evidences, so We forgave/pardoned on that, and We gave Moses evident proof.
And We raised above them the Mountain with their promise/covenant, and We said to them: "Enter the door/entrance prostrating". And We said to them: "Do not transgress/violate in the Saturday/Sabbath". And We took from them a strong promise/covenant.
So with what their breaking/breaching (of) their promise/covenant, and their disbelief with God's signs/verses/evidences, and their killing (of) the prophets, without right, and their saying: "Our hearts/minds (are) covered/uncomprehending." But God stamped/covered/closed/sealed on it, with their disbelief, so they do not believe except a few.

But God rose him (Jesus) to Him, and God was/is glorious/mighty, wise/judicious.
And that from The Book's people, except to believe (E) with him (Jesus) before his (the individual's) death, and (on) the Resurrection Day, he (Jesus) will be on them a witness/testifier.
So with injustice from those who (were) guided/Jews, We forbade/prohibited on them goodnesses (that) were (previously) permitted for them, and with their much prevention/obstruction from God's way/path.
And their taking the interest/usury, and they had been forbidden/prevented from it, and their eating the people's properties/possessions with the falsehood (could include unjust taxes), and We prepared to the disbelievers from them, a painful torture.
But the affirmed in the knowledge from them, and the believers, they believe with what was descended to you, and what was descended from before you, and the keeping up (of) the prayers, and the giving the charity, and the believing with God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, those, We will give/bring them a great reward.
That We inspired/transmitted to you, as We inspired/transmitted to Noah and the prophets from after him, and We inspired/transmitted to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/Jewish tribes, and Jesus, and Job, and Jonah and Aaron, and Solomon, and We gave David a Book.
And messengers We had narrated/relayed them to you from before, and messengers We did not narrate/relay about them on you, and God conversed/spoke (to) Moses conversationally/speechfully.64

But God witnesses/testifies with what He descended to you, He descended it with His knowledge, and the angels witness/testify, and enough with God (as) a witness.
That those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God's way/path, they had misguided a distant/far misguidance.
That those who disbelieved and caused injustice/oppression, God was not to forgive for them, and nor to guide them a way/path.
Except Hell's way/path, immortally/eternally in it forever, and that was/is on God easy/little.
You, you the people, the Messenger had come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe, (it is) best for you, and if you disbelieve, so to God (belongs) what (is) in the skies/space, and the earth/Planet Earth, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious
You The Book's people, do not exaggerate/exceed the limit in your religion, and do not say on (about) God except the truth, but the Messiah, Jesus, Mary's son (is) God's messenger and His word/expression He threw it away to Mary, and a Soul/Spirit (could be Gabriel) from Him; so believe with God, and His messengers, and do not say: "Three." Stop (it is) best for you, but God (is) one God, His praise/glory that to be for him a child; for Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, enough/sufficient with God (as a) guardian/protector.
The Messiah will never/not refuse/reject that to be a slave/worshipper to God, and nor the angels the neared/close, and who refuses/rejects from worshipping Him, and becomes arrogant, so He will gather them to Him all together.
So but those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so He fulfills/completes (to) them their rewards, and He increases them from His grace/favour, and but those who refused/rejected and were arrogant, so He tortures them a painful torture, and they do not find for them from other than God, a guardian/ally, and nor a victorior/savior.
You, you the people, a proof had come to you from your Lord, and We descended to you a clear/evident light.
So but those who believed with God, and they held fast with Him, so He will enter them in a mercy from Him, and grace/favour, and guide them a straight/direct road/way to Him.
They ask your opinion/clarification, say: "God decrees/decides in the man or woman without a son/father, if (a) man/human died, not for him (without) a child, and for him (is) a sister, so for her half (of) what he left, and he inherits her if (there) was not for her a child, and if they (B) were two (F), so to them (B/F) the two thirds from what he left, and if they were brothers (siblings) men and women, so to the male equal/alike (the) share (of) the two females, God clarifies for you that (E) you (not) be misguided, and God is with every thing knowledgeable.65
