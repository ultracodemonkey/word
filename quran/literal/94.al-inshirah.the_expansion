Did We not delight/expand your chest (innermost)?
And We raised from you your sin/load/burden.
Which weighed heavily (on)/burdened your back.
And We raised for you your memory/reputation.
So that truly with the difficulty/hardship (is) ease/flexibility.
That truly with the difficulty/hardship (is) ease/flexibility.
So when/if you finished/ended/completed, so work hard/fatigue.
And to your Lord, so wish/desire.
