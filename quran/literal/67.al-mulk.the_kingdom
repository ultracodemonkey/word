Blessed who with His hand (is) the ownership/kingdom, and He is on every thing capable/able.
Who created the death/lifelessness and the life to test you which of you (is) better (in) deeds, and He is the glorious/mighty, the forgiving.
Who created seven skies/space(s) (in) stages/layers, you do not see in the merciful's creation from discrepancy/inconsistency, so return the eyesight do you see from splits/cracks/cleaves?
Then return the eyesight two times/repetitions, the eyesight returns to you diminished/humiliated and it is grieving/uncovered.
And We had decorated/beautified, the sky/space (of) the present world with lights/stars, and We made it meteorites/shooting stars for the devils, and We prepared/made ready for them the/blazing/inflamed (inferno) torture.
And for those who disbelieved with (in) their Lord, Hell's torture, and how bad (is) the end/destination?
When they were thrown in it, they heard for it loud inhalation/loud noise and it, it boils with anger.
It is about to/almost distinguish/separate from the anger/rage, when ever (a) group/band/crowd were thrown in it, its safe-keepers asked them: "Did not a warner/giver of notice come to you?"
They said: "Yes/certainly, a warner/giver of notice had come to us, so we lied/denied/falsified, and we said: 'God did not descend from a thing, that truly you are except in big/great misguidance.'"
And they said: "If we were hearing/listening or reasoning/comprehending we would not have been in (between) the blazing's/inflamed's (inferno's) owners/company/friends."
So they confessed/acknowledged with their crime, so distance/remoteness, to the blazing's/inflamed's (inferno's) owners/company/friends.
That truly those who fear their Lord with the unseen/supernatural, for them (is) a forgiveness and a large/great reward.
And keep your opinion and belief/statement secret, or you publicize/declare with it, that He truly is knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts).
Does he not know whom He created? And He is the most kind/gracious, the expert/ experienced.
He is who made/put for you the earth/Planet Earth manipulated/eased, so walk in its directions/elevations, and eat from His provision, and to him (is) the revival/resurrection.
Did you become safe/secure (trust) whom (are) in the sky/space that (E) He sinks down with you the earth/Planet Earth, so then it agitates/sways ?
Or did you become safe/secure (trust) whom (are) in the sky/space that (E) He sends on you a violent wind carrying pebbles and hail/hail laden clouds? So you will know how was My warning/notice.
And those from before them had (E) lied/denied/falsified, so how was My severity (anger) ?
Do they not see to the birds above them expanded and motionless wings in a row, and they stretch and shrink/speed ? None holds/grasps them except the merciful, that He truly is with every thing seeing/understanding.
Or who (is) that who he is soldiers/warriors for you (and who are your allies that) give you victory/aid from other than the merciful? That truly the disbelievers (are) except in deceit/temptation.
Or who (is) that who provides for you if He held (back)/seized His provision? But they persisted, excessed and insisted in arrogance/disobedience and hastening with aversion.
Is who walks up-side-down/facing down on his face/front more guided? Or who walks straight/upright on a straight/direct road/way?
Say: "He is who created/originated you, and made for you the hearing/listening, and the eyesights/knowledge, and the hearts, little (is) what you thank/be grateful."
Say: "He is who created/seeded you in the earth/Planet Earth and to Him you are being gathered."
And they say: "When/at what time (is) that the promise if you were truthful?"
Say: "But/truly the knowledge (is) at God, and but/truly I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice."
So when they saw it in close proximity/close, those who disbelieved's faces/fronts became bad/evil/harmful, and (it) was said: "That (is) what you were with it calling (hastening)."
Say: "Did you see if God punished/destroyed me and who (is) with me? Or had mercy upon us? So who protects/defends the disbelievers from a painful torture?"
Say: "He is the merciful, we believed with (in) Him and on Him we relied/depended, so you will know who He is in clear/evident misguidance."
Say: "Did you see/understand if your water became/became in the morning deeply sunk/bottomed ? So who comes/brings to you with water flowing easily and plentifully?"429
