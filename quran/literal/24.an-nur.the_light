And We had descended to you verses/evidences evident, and an example/proverb from those who past/expired from before you, and an advice/warning to the fearing and obeying.
God (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's light, His light's example/proverb (is) as/like a niche in it a light/lamp, the light/lamp (is) in a clear and transparent glass container, the clear and transparent glass container is as though it (is) a pearly/luminous star/planet, (it) is being ignited/lit from a blessed tree, an olive not eastern and not western, its oil is about to/almost to lighten/illuminate, and even if fire did not touch it. Light on/over light, God guides to His light whom He wills/wants, and God gives the examples/proverbs to the people, and God (is) with every thing knowledgeable.
In houses/homes God permitted/allowed that (it) be raised/honoured and be mentioned/remembered in it his name; praises/glorifies to Him in it at the early morning and the evenings to sunsets.
Men commercial trade and nor selling/trading does not distract/divert them from247mentioning/remembering God, and keeping up the prayers and giving/bringing the charity/purification, they fear a day/time the hearts/minds and the eye sight/knowledge turns around in it.
(For) God to reward/reimburse them best (of) what they made/did, and He increases them from His grace/favour/blessing, and God provides for whom He wills/wants without counting/calculating.
And those who disbelieved their deeds (are) as a mirage at a plain land (desert) the thirsty thinks/supposes it (is) water, until when he came to it, he did not find it a thing, and he found God at it, so He fulfilled/completed him his account/calculation, and God (is) fast/quick (in) the counting/calculating.
Or as darknesses in a wide roaring and noisy sea/ocean, waves/surges cover/darken him/it, from above it waves/surges, from above it clouds, darknesses, some of it (is) above some, if he brought out his hand he is not about to/almost see it, and who God did not make/put for him light, so (there is) none from light (is) to/for him.
Do you see/understand that God praises/glorifies for Him whom (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and birds (with) expanded and motionless wings in a row? Each had known its prayers and its praise/glorification, and God (is) knowledgeable with what they make/do.
And to God (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/kingdom, and to God (is) the end/destination.
Do you not see/understand that God drives/eases gently clouds, then He unites/joins between it, then He makes it piled/accumulated, so you see the rain emerges from in between and around it, and He descends from the sky from mountains in it from hail, so He strikes with it whom He wills/wants, and He diverts it from whom He wills/wants, its lightning's shine/flash almost eliminates with the eye sights/knowledge.
God turns the night and the daytime, that truly in that (is) an example/warning (E) to (those) of the eye sights/knowledge.
And God created every/each walker/creeper/crawler from water, so from them who walks (moves) on its belly, and from them who walks on two feet, and from them who walks on four, God creates what He wills/wants, that truly God (is) on every thing capable/powerful.
We had descended verses/evidences evident, and God guides whom He wills/wants to a straight/direct road/way.

Is there in their hearts/minds sickness/disease, or they became doubtful/suspicious, or they fear that God and His messenger be unfair/inequitable on (to) them? But those are the unjust/oppressive.
But the believers' word/opinion and belief if they were called to God and His messenger to judge/rule between248them was that they say: "We heard/listened and we obeyed." And those are the successful/winners.
And who obeys God and His messenger, and fears God, and fears and obeys Him, so those are the successful/triumphant.
And they swore/made oath by God their rights'/oaths' utmost, if (E) you ordered/commanded them they will get out (E), say: "Do not swear/make oath, known obedience, that God (is) expert/experienced with what you make/do."
Say: "Obey God and obey the messenger." So if they turned away, so but on him what he was made to carry,and on you what you were made to carry, and if you obey him/Him you will be guided, and nothing (is) on the messenger except the information/communication, the clear/evident."
God promised those who believed from you, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, He makes them successors in the earth/Planet Earth, as He made successors those from before them, and to highly position/strengthen (E) for them their religion which He accepted/approved for them, He will exchange/replace them (E) safety/security from after their fear/fright, they worship Me, they do not share/made partners with Me a thing, and who disbelieved after that, so those are the debauchers.
And keep up the prayers, and give/bring the charity/purification, and obey the messenger, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy.

You, you those who believed, those who your rights (hands) owned/possessed (i.e. care-givers under contract), and those who did not reach the puberty/sexual maturity from you should ask for your permission three times, from before the dawn's prayers, and when you put your clothes/garments (on) from the noon/midday, and from after the evening/first darkness prayers, three shameful genital parts (protective times are) for you, an offense/sin is not on you, and nor on them after them (the three times) circling/walking around on you, some of you to some, as/like that God clarifies/shows/explains for you the verses/evidences, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.

But the believers (are) those who believed by God and His messenger, and if they were with Him on (a) gathering and important matter/affair, they do not go/go away until they ask for his permission/pardon, that those who ask for your permission/pardon, those are, those who believe by God and His messenger, so if they asked for your permission/pardon for some (of) their affair/concern, so permit/allow to whom you willed/wanted from them, and ask God for forgiveness for them, that God (is) forgiving, merciful.
Do not make calling the messenger between you as calling some of you (to) some, God had been know(ing) those who sneak/slip away taking refuge/dodging from you, so those who differ/disagree from His order/command should be warned/cautious that misguidance/seduction or a painful torture strikes them.
Is it not that to God what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth? God has been know(ing) what you are on it, and a day/time they be return(ed) to Him, so He informs them with what they made/did, and God (is) with every thing knowledgeable.250
