Say: "I seek protection with/by Lord/master/owner (of) the daybreak/creation."
From bad/evil/harm (of) what He created.
And from bad/evil/harm (of an) intense dark night/moon, when/if (it) penetrated through body pores/ spread/approached.
And from bad/evil/harm (of) the female magicians/sorceresses/dischargers in the knots.
And from bad/evil/harm (of) an envious with jealousy, when/if he envied with jealousy.
