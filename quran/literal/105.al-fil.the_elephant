Did you not see/understand how (what) your Lord made/did with the elephant's owners/company/ friends?
Did He not make their plotting/conspiring in misguidance?
And He sent on them flying/birds (in) flocks/groups gathered and following each other.
It throws them with stones from dry and hardened mud.
So He made them like eaten husk/chaff/leaves.
