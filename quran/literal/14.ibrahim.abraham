A L R a Book We descended it to you, to bring the people out from the darknesses to the light with their Lord's permission, to the glorious's/mighty's the praise worthy's/commendable's way/path.
God, (is) who to Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and grief/distress to the disbelievers from strong (severe) torture.
Those who love/like (prefer) the life the present/worldly life over the end (other life), and they obstruct/prevent from God's way/path and they desire it (be) bent/crookedness, those are in distant/far misguidance.
And We did not send from a messenger except with his nation's tongue/language, to clarify/explain to them, so God misguides whom He wills/wants, and He guides whom He wills/wants, and He is the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious.
And We had sent Moses with Our signs/evidences/verses: "That bring out your nation from the darknesses to the light, and remind them with God's days/times that in that (are) evidences/verses to every patient/endurer, thankful/grateful."
And when Moses said to his nation: "Remember/mention God's blessing/goodness on you, when He saved/rescued you from Pharaoh's family, they impose upon you the torture's harm/evil, and they slaughter your sons and they shame your women, and in that is a great test from your Lord.
And when your Lord announced/informed if (E) you thanked/became grateful, I will increase you (E), and if (E) you disbelieved that My torture (is) strong (E) (severe).
And Moses said: "If you disbelieve you and who (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all together, so then God (is) rich (E) praiseworthy/commendable."
Did not information/news (of) those from before you come to you, nation (of) Noah and Aad and Thamud and those from after them? No (one) knows them except God, their messengers came to them with the evidences, so they returned their hands in their mouths (they bit their fingers from anger), and they said: "We have disbelieved with what you were sent with it, and we are in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from what you call us to it."
Their messenger said: "Is (there) doubt/suspicion in God, creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, He calls you to forgive for you from your crimes, and He delays you to (a) named/identified term/time?" They said: "That you are except humans similar/equal to us, you want/intend that you prevent/obstruct us from what our fathers were worshipping, so come to us/bring to us with a clear/evident proof/evidence."
Their messengers said to them: "That we are except humans similar/equal to you, and but God blesses on whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, and (it) was not for us that we come to you with a proof/evidence, except with God's permission, and on God so should the believers rely/depend."
And why not for us that we not, rely/depend on God, and He had guided us (to) our ways/paths, and we will be patient (E) on what you harmed us mildly (with it), and on God so should rely/depend the reliant/dependent.
And those who disbelieved said to their messengers: "We will bring/drive you (E) out from our land/Earth, or you return (E) in (to) our religion/faith." So their Lord inspired/transmitted to them: "We will make die/destroy (E) the unjust/oppressors."
And We will make you reside/inhabit (E) the land/Earth from after them, that (is) to who feared My place/position, and feared My threat.
And they seeked victory/judgment, and every stubborn/obstinate tyrant/rebel failed/despaired.
From behind him (is) Hell, and he be given drink from pussy water.

(The) example/proverb (of) those who disbelieved with their Lord, their deeds (are) like ashes, the wind strengthened in a stormy/violent day, they do (can) not be capable/able on a thing from what they gained/acquired, that (is) the misguidance, the distant/far.
Do you not see/understand that God created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth, if He wills/wants He eliminates you and comes with a new creation?
And that is not with a powerful/undefeatable on God.
And they emerged/appeared to God all together, so the weak said to those who were arrogant: "That we, we were for you following, so are you sufficing/availing (helping) from us from (against) God's torture from a thing?" They said: "If God guided us, we would have guided you, (it is) equal on (to) us if we became grievous worried and impatient or we were patient, (there is) none from an escape/diversion for us."
And the devil said when the matter/affair/order/command was passed/judged : "That God promised you, the truth's promise, and I promised you, so I broke the promise to you, and (there) was not from a power/control to me on you except that I called you, so you answered/replied to me, so do not blame/reprimand me and blame/reprimand yourselves, I am not with aiding you (a savior), and you are not with aiding me, that I disbelieved with what you made me a partner (with God) from before. That the unjust/oppressive, for them (is) a painful torture."
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds were made to enter treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it immortally/eternally in it, with their Lord's permission, their greeting in it (is): "A security/peace."
Do you not see/understand how God gave an example/proverb, (of) a good/pure word/expression,as a good/pure tree, its root (is) affirmed/established (fixed) and its branch/top (is) in the sky?
It gives/brings its food/fruits every period of time with its Lord's permission, and God gives the example/proverbs to the people, perhaps they mention/remember.172
And (the) example/proverb (of) a bad/spoiled word/expression (is) as a bad/spoiled tree, (it) was uprooted/cut down from above the ground, no bottom (root is) for it.

And they made/put to God equals (idols) to misguide from His way/path, say: "Live long/enjoy so that your end/destination (is) to the fire."
Say to My worshippers/slaves those who believed: "They (should) keep up the prayers and spend from what We provided for them secretly and publicly from before that a day comes, (where there is) no selling/trading in it and nor differences in opinions/friendships.
God is who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He descended from the sky water so He brought out with it from the fruits a provision for you, and He manipulated for you the ships to flow/pass/orbit in the sea/river/ocean with His order/command, and He manipulated for you the rivers/waterways.
