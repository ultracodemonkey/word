In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. [1]
All praise is for Allah, the ‘Lord’ of the Worlds. [2]
The Compassionate, the Merciful. [3]
Master of the Day of Judgment. [4]
O’Allah! You Alone we worship and You Alone we call on for help.[5]
O’Allah! Guide us to The Right Way. [6]
The Way of those whom You have favored; not of those who have earned Your wrath, or of those who have lost The Way. [7]
