By the fig and by the olive,[1]
by the mount of Sinai[2]
and by this city of peace  (Mecca).[3]
We have indeed created man in the best stature;[4]
then We abase him  to the lowest of the low[5]
except those who believe and do good deeds - for they  shall have a never ending reward.[6]
So, what causes them to disbelieve you  concerning the Day of Judgment?[7]
Is not Allah the best of all judges?[8]
