O mankind, you have been distracted by the rivalry of piling up worldly gains against  one another.[1]
You will never be satisfied until you get into the grave.[2]
Nevertheless, soon you shall come to know.[3]
Again, nevertheless, soon you shall  come to know.[4]
Nay! Would that you knew through the real knowledge provided to  you in this Qur’an and care about your life in the Hereafter.[5]
Because on the Day of  Judgment when you shall see the hell,[6]
and see it with the certainty of your own  eyes[7]
- you shall believe it, but that belief is going to do you no good because - on  that Day, you shall be questioned about the blessings (faculties and resources that  you were given in the worldly life - as to how you used them?)[8]
