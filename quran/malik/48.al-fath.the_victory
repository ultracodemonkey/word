O Prophet, Surely We have granted you a manifest victory,[1]
so that Allah may  forgive your past as well as your future sins, and may perfect His blessings upon you,  and keep you on the Right Way,[2]
and that Allah may bestow on you His mighty  help.[3]
It was He who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers, so that  they may add more faith to their Faith. To Allah belong the forces of the heavens and  the earth. Allah is All-Knowledgeable, All-Wise.[4]
He has caused you to do as you  have done, so that He may admit the believing men and believing women into the  gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever and remove their ills from  them; and that is the highest achievement for men in the sight of Allah.[5]
And that  He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the pagan men  and the pagan women, who entertained an evil thought about Allah. A turn of evil  shall befall them, for Allah's wrath is upon them. He has laid His curse on them and  prepared for them the fire of hell, which is a very evil abode.[6]
To Allah belongs the  forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.[7]
O Prophet,  We have sent you as a witness, as a bearer of good news, and as a Warner.[8]
So  that you, O people, may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you may help  him and honor him and glorify Allah morning and evening.[9]
Surely those who swore  allegiance to you O Prophet, indeed swore allegiance to Allah Himself. The Hand of  Allah was above their hands. Now, the one who will break his pledge, will break it at  his own peril, and the one who will keep his pledge that he has made with Allah, shall  soon be given a great reward by Him.[10]
The beduin Arabs who stayed behind will soon say to you: "Our goods and families  kept us occupied, so please ask forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues  what is not in their hearts. Tell them: "Who can intervene on your behalf with Allah if it  be His will to do you harm or He pleases to do you good? Allah is well aware of your  actions.[11]
Rather you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never  return to their families; this fancy seemed pleasing to your hearts. You conceived evil  thoughts and thus incurred damnation."[12]
He who does not believe in Allah and His  Messenger, We have prepared a blazing fire for such unbelievers.[13]
To Allah  belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He pleases  and He punishes whom He wills. Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.[14]
When you  set forth to take the spoils of war, those who stayed behind will say: "Let us come  with you." They wish to change Allah’s decree. Tell them plainly: "You shall not come  with us. Allah has already said this before." Then they will say: "Nay! But you are  jealous of us." Whereas there is no question of jealousy, but little do they understand  such things.[15]
Tell the beduin Arabs who stayed behind: "You shall soon be called  upon to fight against a mighty people then either you will fight or they will embrace  Islam. Then if you obey, Allah will grant you a good reward, but if you turn away as  you have done before, He will inflict on you a painful penalty."[16]
There is no blame  on the blind, the lame, and the sick if they stay behind. He that obeys Allah and His  Messenger shall be admitted to gardens beneath which the rivers flow, and he that  turns away shall be punished with a painful punishment.[17]
Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under  the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity upon them  and He rewarded them with a speedy victory,[18]
and many spoils which they will  soon acquire. Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.[19]
Allah has promised you many spoils  which you shall acquire, and has given you these spoils of Khayber with all  promptness. He has restrained the hands of enemies from you, so that it may serve  as a sign to the believers and that He may guide you to the Right Way.[20]
Besides,  He promises you other spoils as well, which are not yet within your reach but Allah  has surely encompassed them. Allah has power over everything.[21]
Even if the  unbelievers had fought with you, they would have been put to flight, and would have  not found any protector or helper.[22]
Such has been the practice of Allah in the past;  and you shall find no change in the practice of Allah.[23]
It is He Who has restrained  their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca, after that He  had given you victory over them, and Allah was watching all your actions.[24]
They  are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from the Masjid-al-Haram (Sacred  Mosque - Ka'bah) and prevented your offerings from reaching their destination. Had  there not been believing men and believing women in the city of Mecca, whom you  did not know, and their possibility of being trampled under your feet and thus  incurring unwitting guilt on their account, Allah would have allowed you to fight, but  He held back your hands, so that He may admit to His mercy whom He will. Had the  believers stood apart from them, We would certainly have punished the disbelievers  among them with painful punishment.[25]
While the unbelievers set up in their hearts  the arrogance - the arrogance of the time of ignorance - Allah sent down His  tranquillity upon His Messenger and the believers and made the believers to adhere  to the word of piety; for they were most worthy and deserving of it. Allah has full  knowledge of everything.[26]
Indeed Allah has in all truth shown the vision to His Messenger, that, Allah willing,  you shall enter the Masjid-al-Haram (Ka'bah) fearless and secure to perform Umrah  or Hajj and some having their heads shaved and others having their hair cut, for He  knows what you do not know. So, He granted you a near victory before the fulfillment  of that vision.[27]
It is He who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the  religion of truth, so that He may exalt this religion over all other religions: and  sufficient is Allah as a witness.[28]
Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, and those  with him are strong against the unbelievers and compassionate to each other among  themselves. When you see them, you will find them making Rakuh (bowing down)  and Sajud (prostrate in prayers), and craving for the blessings from Allah and His  good pleasure. They have the marks of Sajud (prostration) on their foreheads, the  traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Torah; and their similitude in  the Gospel: they are like the seed which puts forth its sprout, then strengthens it,  then becomes thick and stands firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers of the seed,  so that through them He may enrage the unbelievers. Yet to those of them who will  believe and do good deeds, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward.[29]
