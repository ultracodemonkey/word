Woe to every slanderer and defamer,[1]
who amasses wealth and keeps on counting  it.[2]
He thinks that his wealth will insure his status forever![3]
By no means! He shall  be thrown into Hotamah.[4]
What will make you understand what Hotamah is?[5]
It is  the fire kindled to a blaze by Allah Himself.[6]
The one which will rise right to the  hearts,[7]
closing in upon them from every side[8]
in outstretched columns.[9]
