O Prophet! Have We not expanded your breast for you[1]
and relieved you from the  burden[2]
which weighed down your back,[3]
and exalted your fame?[4]
Surely with  every difficulty there is relief.[5]
Surely with every difficulty there is relief.[6]
Therefore, when you are free from your daily task, devote your time to the labor of  worship[7]
and turn all your attention towards your Lord.[8]
