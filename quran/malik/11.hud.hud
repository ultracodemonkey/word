Alif L'am R'a. This Book, whose verses are perfected and issued in detail by the One  Who is All-Wise, All-Aware,[1]
teaches that you should worship none but Allah indeed  I am a warner and bearer of good news from Him to you.[2]
You should seek  forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance; He will grant you good  provisions untill an appointed term, and bestow His grace on everyone who has  merit! But if you turn away, I fear for you the punishment of a Great Day.[3]
To Allah  you shall all return and He has power over everything.[4]
Behold! They cover up their  chests to conceal their thoughts from Him! Beware! Even when they cover  themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal,  for He knows even the inmost secrets of the chests.[5]
There is no moving creature on Earth whose sustenance is not provided by Allah. He  knows its living and its resting place, and all that is recorded in a Glorious Book. [6]
He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods - at the time  when His Throne was resting on the water - so that He may test to find out which of  you is the best in deeds. Now if you tell them:" You shall indeed be raised up after  death," the unbelievers would certainly say: "This is nothing but sheer magic!"[7]
And  if We put off their punishment till an appointed time, they are sure to ask: "What is  holding it back?" Beware! When the Day of that punishment comes, nothing will hold  it back from them and they will be completely encircled by that which they are  ridiculing.[8]
If We let man taste any mercy from Us, then withdraw it from him, he becomes  despairing, ungrateful.[9]
But if We let him taste any favor after adversity has afflicted  him, then he says: "All my sorrows are gone from me," and he becomes jubilantly  arrogant.[10]
The exception is for those people who are steadfast and do good  deeds; they are the ones who will have forgiveness and a great reward.[11]
O  Prophet, be on your guard lest you omit to recite some things which are being  revealed to you feeling distressed in your heart that they might say: "Why has no  treasure been sent down to him, or why has no angel come with him?" You should  know that you are nothing but a Warner! It is Allah Who is the Custodian of  everything.[12]
Do they say: "He has made up the Qur’an himself." Say to them:  "Make up ten Surahs like this and call to your aid whomsoever you can, including  your gods whom you worship besides Allah, if what you say is true.[13]
But if those  gods fail to answer you, then you should know that (they are false gods and that) this  (Book) is revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god but Him! Will  you then become Muslims?"[14]
Those who desire the life of this world and its splendors, they are given full reward of  their deeds therein and shall not be diminished.[15]
They are the ones who will have  nothing in the hereafter except Hellfire. There they shall come to know that their  deeds were fruitless and their actions were worthless.[16]
Can they be like those  who have clear revelations from their Lord and to whom a witness from Himself  recites it, and they have the Book of Moses before them - a guidance and a  blessing? Can such people deny the revelation of Al- Qur’an? No of course not,  rather such people will believe in this, but those factions who do not believe shall  have their promised place in the Hellfire. So, O Prophet, do not be in any doubt about  it; it is the Truth from your Lord, even though most people do not believe so.[17]
Who  can be more wrong than the one who forges a lie against Allah? Such people will be  brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say: "These are the ones who lied  against their Lord." Beware! The Curse of Allah is on those wrongdoers[18]
who  hinder others from the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and who deny the  hereafter.[19]
These people cannot frustrate His plan in the land and there is none to  protect them besides Allah. Their punishment shall be doubled, for they could neither  hear others who speak the Truth nor see the Truth for themselves.[20]
They are the  ones who have lost their own souls, and the fancies they invented have left them in  the lurch.[21]
No doubt they will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.[22]
As for  those who believe and do good deeds and humble themselves before their Lord, they  will be residents of paradise to live therein forever.[23]
The example of these two  kinds of people is like two men, one of whom is blind and deaf, and the other who  can see and hear. Are they equal when compared? Will you not then learn a lesson  from this example?[24]
We sent Noah to his people. Noah said: "I have come to warn you plainly,[25]
not to  worship anyone except Allah; otherwise I am afraid for you the punishment of a  painful Day."[26]
In answer to this, the chiefs of the unbelievers among his people  said: "We see you as no more than merely a human being like ourselves: and we see  that no one has followed you except the meanest among us, whose judgement  abilities are immature, and we find nothing in you which gives you superiority over us:  in fact we think that you are a liar."[27]
He said: "O my people, look! If I am given  clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed on me His grace, although it be  hidden from you, can we compel you to accept it against your will?[28]
O my people!  I do not ask you any wealth for this work, for none but Allah can reward me. I am not  going to drive away those who believe; for they will surely meet their Lord. But I can  see that you are acting out of ignorance.[29]
And O my people! Who will save me  from Allah, if I drive them away? Don’t you understand this simple thing?[30]
I do not  say that I possess the Treasures of Allah, nor do I say that I have knowledge of the  unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel; nor do I say of those who are mean in your  eyes, that Allah will not grant them any good - Allah knows best what is in their hearts  -for if I utter any thing like this, then I will indeed become a wrongdoer."[31]
They  said: "O Noah! You have argued with us and argued too much, now bring upon us  the scourge with which you threaten us, if what you say is true."[32]
He replied: "  Allah will surely bring it on you if He pleases and then you will not be able to escape  from it![33]
My counsel will not profit you, much as I desire to give you good counsel,  if Allah wants to leave you astray; He is your Lord, and to Him you shall return." [34]
Do the unbelievers say "He (Muhammad) himself has forged all this?" Say to them:  "If I have indeed forged it, then its sin is on me! And I am clear of the sins which you  are committing for not believing it."[35]
And it was revealed to Noah: "None of your people will believe now, other than those  who have already believed. So do not grieve at their evil deeds.[36]
Build an ark  under Our supervision in accordance with Our revelation, and beware not to plead  with Me on behalf of those who are wrongdoers: for they are all to be drowned in the  flood."[37]
So he started to build the ark; and whenever the chiefs of his people  passed by him they laughed at him. He said: "Laugh at us now if you will, soon the  time is going to come when we too will laugh at you as you are laughing at us.[38]
Soon you will come to know who will be seized by a humiliating scourge, and who is  afflicted with everlasting punishment."[39]
Finally when Our Command came and the water from Al-Tannur (a particular oven  marked as a starting point to warn Noah in order to get him ready to board the ark)  gushed forth! We said to Noah: "Take into the Ark a pair from every species, your  family - except those against whom the Word has already gone forth - and the  believers and those who believed with him were only a few."[40]
Thus he said:  "Embark in it, in the name of Allah in whose hands is its sailing and its stopping;  surely my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."[41]
As the ark floated with them on board over the mountainous waves and Noah called  out to his son, who stood apart: "O my son! Embark with us and be not with the  unbelievers!"[42]
He replied: "I will take refuge on some mountain, which will save  me from the flood." Noah said: "None shall be secure today from the judgement of  Allah, except the one on whom He has mercy!" And thereupon a wave came  between them and he (Noah’s son) became among one of those who drowned.[43]
Finally, Allah said: "O earth! Swallow up your water," and "O sky! Cease your rain."  The floodwater abated and the judgement was carried out. The ark rested on Mount  Al-Judi and it was said: "Gone are the wrongdoing people!"[44]
Noah called out to his  Lord saying: "O my Lord! My son is of my family, and surely Your promise is true and  You are the most just of all Judges!"[45]
Allah replied: "O Noah! In fact he is not of  your family; for he is not of righteous conduct. So do not ask Me anything of which  you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you become one of the ignorant!" [46]
Noah said: "My Lord! I seek refuge in You for asking You that of which I have no  knowledge; and unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I shall surely be  lost!"[47]
It was said: "O Noah! Disembark (from the ark) with Our peace and  blessings on you and on the peoples who are with you. As for other people, We shall  grant them the provisions of life for some time, and if they do not behave righteously,  then they shall have a painful punishment from Us."[48]
O Muhammad, these are  some of the facts from the unseen history which We have now revealed to you:  neither you nor your people knew about it before. So have patience; surely the end is  for the righteous.[49]
To the people of ‘Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said: "O my people! Worship  Allah, you have no god but Him; otherwise you are just making things up.[50]
O my  people! I do not ask you any reward for my services; for none can reward me except  my Creator. Will you not then use your common sense?[51]
And O my people! Seek  forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. He will send you from the sky  abundant rain and He will add strength to your strength. So do not turn away like  criminals." [52]
They said: "O Hud! You have given us no clear proof. We are neither  going to desert our gods just on your word, nor we are going to believe in you.[53]
We rather believe that perhaps some of our gods have afflicted you with evil." He  said: "Allah is my witness and let you also be my witness that I am done with your  shirk of worshipping other deities besides Him.[54]
So let all of you scheme against  me if you will, and give me no respite.[55]
I have put my trust in Allah, Who is my  Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature (in the Earth) whose destiny is not  controlled by Him. Indeed straight is the Way of my Lord.[56]
Now, even if you turn  away, I have at least conveyed the message with which I was sent to you. Since you  have denied Him, my Lord will raise up some other people in your place, and you  cannot harm Him in any way. Indeed my Lord is watching over everything."[57]
When  Our judgement came to pass, We saved Hud and those who believed with him  through a special grace from Us - We did save them from a horrifying scourge.[58]
Such were the people of 'Ad. They denied the revelations of their Lord, disobeyed His  Messenger, and followed the command of every stubborn oppressor. [59]
They were  followed by a curse in this world, and cursed they shall be on the Day of  Resurrection. Beware! 'Ad denied their Lord. Beware! Gone are 'Ad, the people of  Hud.[60]
To the Thamud people, We sent their brother Saleh. He said: "O my people! Worship  Allah, you have no god but Him. It is He Who created you from the earth and made it  a dwelling place for you. So seek forgiveness from Him and turn to Him in  repentance. Surely my Lord is very close, ready to answer."[61]
They said: "O Saleh!  Till now you were the one in whom we had great expectations! Would you now forbid  us the worship of what our forefathers worshipped? Indeed, we strongly doubt that to  which you are calling us."[62]
He said: "O my people! Tell me, if I have a clear proof  from my Lord and He has granted me mercy from Himself - who then will help me  against Allah if I disobey Him? What would you add other than to make me lose even  more?[63]
And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you. Leave her to  pasture on Allah’s earth and do not molest her lest a swift scourge should fall upon  you!"[64]
But, even after the warning, they hamstring her. So he said: "You have but  three days to enjoy your homes, that is a promise which will not be repudiated!"[65]
When Our Judgement came to pass, We saved Saleh and those who believed with  him through a special grace from Us, from the disgrace of that Day. Indeed your Lord  is All-Strong, All-Mighty.[66]
A terrible blast overtook the wrongdoers and by the  morning they were laying with their faces down in their homes,[67]
as if they had  never flourished there. Beware! Thamud denied their Lord. Gone are the people of  Thamud.[68]
Our Messengers came to Abraham with good news. They said "Peace be upon you."  He answered "Peace be upon you too," and hastened to entertain them with a  roasted calf.[69]
But when he saw their hands were not extended towards it, he felt  uneasy with them and started to be afraid of them. They said: "Do not fear. We have  been sent to the people of Lot."[70]
His wife, who was standing there, laughed when  We gave her good news of Allah's giving her a son Isaac and after him a grandson  Jacob.[71]
She said: "O wonder! (An expression to indicate surprise) Shall I bear a  child now when I have become an old woman and my husband has become well  advanced in age? This is indeed a strange thing!" [72]
They said: "Do you wonder at  Allah’s decree? May Allah’s mercy and His blessings be upon you, O residents of the  household; for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory."[73]
When the fear of  Abraham was gone as the good news (of his son and grand son) came to him, he  began to plead with Us for the people of Lot.[74]
Indeed Abraham was forbearing,  tenderhearted and devout.[75]
The angels said: "O Abraham! Leave this topic. The  decree of your Lord has already been issued, now there must come to them a  punishment that cannot be averted!"[76]
When Our messengers, in the form of beautiful young men, came to Lot, he became  upset about them, for he felt helpless to offer them protection against his nation’s  many violent homosexual men. He said: "This is a critical day."[77]
No sooner did the  guests come to him than his people, long addicted to evil practices, came rushing  towards him. He said: "O my people! Here are my daughters - they are purer for you.  Now, fear Allah and do not humiliate me by insulting my guests. Is there not even  one good man among you?"[78]
They said: "Well you know, we have no right to your  daughters. You know fully well what we want."[79]
He said: "I wish I had power to  suppress you or could find some powerful support."[80]
The messengers said: "O  Lot! We are the messengers of your Lord. They will not be able to harm you. Now,  take your family and get out of this town while yet a part of the night remains - and let  none of you turn back - except your wife, who should be left behind. She will face the  same fate as they. Their scheduled time of doom is the morning. Is not the morning  very close?"[81]
When Our Judgement came to pass, We turned the cities upside  down and rained down on them brimstones of baked clay, layer upon layer,[82]
specially marked by your Lord. Such scourge is not far off from the wrongdoers![83]
To the people of Median We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said: "O my people!  Worship Allah, you have no god but Him. Do not give short measure and weight.  Although I see you in prosperity today, I fear for you the scourge of a Day that will  encircle you.[84]
O my people! Give full measure and weight in all fairness. Do not  defraud people of their goods and do not spread mischief in the land.[85]
What  remains with Allah is better for you if you are true believers, and I am not set up as a  guardian over you." [86]
They said: "Oh Shu’aib! Does your Salah (prayer) command  you that we give up all those deities whom our forefathers worshipped or that we  have no right of doing what we like with our own goods? For sure, you are the only  gracious and righteous man left in the land!"[87]
He said: "O my people! You see, if I  have a clear sign from my Lord and He has given me good sustenance from Himself  how can I, then, be a party to your evil and unlawful practices? I do not want to  oppose you in what I am forbidding you. I desire nothing but to reform so far as I can  manage. My success in this task depends entirely on the help of Allah; in Him do I  trust and to Him do I turn for everything.[88]
O my people! Let not my dispute with  you bring upon you the doom similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hud or of  Saleh, nor are the people of Lot far off from you; [89]
seek forgiveness of your Lord  and turn to Him in repentance; for my Lord is indeed Merciful, Affectionate."[90]
They said: "O Shu'aib! We do not comprehend much of what you say. In fact, we see  that you are a powerless person among us. Were it not for your family, we certainly  would have stoned you, for you are not strong enough to prevail against us."[91]
He  said: "O my people! Do you regard my family to be more powerful than Allah, that you  have disregarded Him totally as a thing cast behind your back? Surely my Lord  encompasses all that you do.[92]
O my people! You keep on doing your way, and I  shall keep up mine: soon you will find out who receives the disgraceful punishment  and who is a liar! Wait if you will; I too am waiting with you!"[93]
When Our  judgement came to pass, We delivered Shu'aib and those who believed with him  through Our special mercy. A mighty blast seized the wrongdoers and they lay dead  with their faces down in their homes by the morning,[94]
as if they had never  flourished there. Behold! Like Thamud, gone are the people of Median![95]
We sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority[96]
to Pharoah (Pharaoh) and his  chiefs; but they followed the command of Pharoah, and the command of Pharoah  was not right.[97]
He will be in front of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will  bring them down to Hell. How awful will be the place to which they will be  brought?[98]
A curse followed them in this life, and a curse will follow them on the  Day of Resurrection. What an evil reward for one to receive.[99]
These are the  stories of the nations which We relate to you; of them some have survived and some  have ceased to exist.[100]
We were not unjust to them, but they were unjust to  themselves. The deities they invoked beside Allah did not avail them when the  judgement of your Lord came to pass; they added nothing to their lot but  perdition.[101]
Such is the scourge of your Lord when He seizes a sinful town;  indeed, His seizure is terrible and painful.[102]
In fact, there is a sign in this for those  who fear the punishment of the hereafter; that is a Day in which mankind will be  gathered together and that will be a Day of Testimony.[103]
We do not delay it but to  the appointed deadline.[104]
When the Day will come, no one shall dare to speak  except with His permission. Of them, some will be damned and some will be  blessed.[105]
Those who are damned shall be in the fire; in there, they will have only  sighs and sobs.[106]
They will dwell therein as long as the heavens and the earth  shall last, unless your Lord ordains otherwise; surely your Lord is the mighty doer of  what He intends.[107]
As for those who are blessed, they shall be in paradise. They  will dwell therein as long as the heavens and the earth shall last, unless your Lord  ordain otherwise; an award which shall never be taken away.[108]
Therefore, have  no doubt concerning the deities they worship, for they blindly imitate the worship of  those deities whom their forefathers used to worship before them; and surely, We  shall give them their share of punishment in full without any abatement.[109]
We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose about it; had not a Word  gone forth from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them  regarding those differences. It is a fact that they are in suspicious doubt about  this,[110]
and it is also a fact that your Lord will give them full measure for their  deeds, for He is fully aware of what they do.[111]
Therefore, stand firm on the Right  Way as you are commanded, together with those who have turned from unbelief to  belief in Allah, and do not transgress; surely, He is watching all that you do.[112]
Do  not be inclined to those who are unjust, lest you be seized by the fire; and you will not  have any protector besides Allah, nor you shall be helped.[113]
Establish Salah ( prayers) at the two ends of the day and in the early part of the  night. Indeed virtues remove evils. This is a reminder for the mindful.[114]
Be patient;  for sure Allah does not let the reward of the righteous be wasted.[115]
Why were  there not among the generations before you, good persons who could forbid the  people from making mischief in the land, except a few of those whom We delivered  from among them? The wrongdoers, however, pursued the worldly pleasure they  were provided, and became confirmed criminals.[116]
It is not possible that your Lord  would destroy the towns unjustly while their habitants were to mend their ways.[117]
If your Lord had so willed, He would have certainly made mankind one single nation  but that is not what He wants, so they will continue to differ[118]
except those on  whom He has bestowed His mercy; and that very freedom of choice and action is the  whole purpose of their creation. That is how the Word of your Lord, that He will fill  Hell with jinns and human beings all together, will be fulfilled.[119]
All these stories of  the prior Messengers that We relate to you (O Muhammad) are to strengthen your  heart therewith; through these you have received the knowledge of reality and the  believers have gotten admonition and a reminder. [120]
As for those who are  unbelievers, say to them: "Do whatever you want, and so shall we.[121]
Wait if you  will! Surely, we too shall wait."[122]
Allah Alone has the knowledge of what is hidden  in the heavens and the earth, and everything shall ultimately return to Him for  decision; Therefore, worship Him and put your trust in Him, and your Lord is not  unmindful of what you do.[123]
