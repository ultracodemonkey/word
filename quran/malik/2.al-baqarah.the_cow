Alif L'am M'im.[1]
This is the Book in which there is no doubt. (Since its Author, Allah,  the Creator of this universe, possesses complete knowledge, there is no room for  doubt about its contents.) It is a guide for those who are God conscious,[2]
who  believe in the Unseen, who establish Salah (five regular daily prayers) and spend in  charity out of what We have provided for their sustenance;[3]
who believe in this  Revelation (the Qur'an) which is sent to you (O Muhammad) and the Revelations  which were sent before you (Torah, Psalms, Gospel...) and firmly believe in the  Hereafter.[4]
They are on true Guidance from their Lord and they are the ones who  will attain salvation.[5]
In fact, as for those who reject Faith; it is the same, whether you warn them or you  don't, they will not believe.[6]
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, their  eyes are covered, and there is a grievous punishment for them.[7]
There are some people who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day" yet they are  not true believers.[8]
They try to deceive Allah and the believers. However, they  deceive none except themselves yet they do not realize it.[9]
There is a disease of  deception in their heart; and Allah lets their disease increase, and they shall have  painful punishment for the lies they have told.[10]
When it is said to them: "Do not  make mischief on earth," they say: "We make peace."[11]
Beware! They are the  ones who make mischief but they do not realize it.[12]
When they are told: "Believe  as the others believe" they ask: "Should we believe like fools?" Be aware! They  themselves are the fools, if only they could understand.[13]
When they meet the  believers they say: "We are believers," but when they are alone with their Satans,  they say: "We are really with you, we were only mocking the believers."[14]
Allah will  throw back their mockery on them and leave them alone in their trespasses; so they  wander to and fro like the blind.[15]
These are the people who barter guidance for  error: but their bargain is profitless and they are not going to be guided.[16]
Their example is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it illuminated all around him  Allah took away their light (their eyesight) and left them in utter darkness: they could  see nothing.[17]
Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will never return to the Right Way.[18]
Or another example is that of a dark storm-cloud in the sky charged with thunder and  lightning. They press their fingers to their ears at the sound of each stunning  thunderclap for fear of death: Allah is encircling the unbelievers from all sides.[19]
The lightning terrifies them as if it was going to snatch away their eyesight; whenever  it flashes they walk on; when it becomes dark, they stand still. And if Allah wanted He  could have totally taken away their hearing and their sight; for Allah has power over  everything.[20]
O mankind! Worship your Lord Who created you and created those who came before  you; by doing this you may expect to guard yourself against evil.[21]
It is He Who has  made the earth a floor for you and the sky a canopy; and it is He Who sends down  rain from the sky for the growth of fruits for your sustenance. Therefore, do not  knowingly set up rivals to Allah.[22]
If you are in doubt as to whether the revelations which We have sent to Our servant  (Muhammad) are from Us or not, then produce one Surah like this; and call your  witnesses (gods that you call upon) besides Allah to assist you, if you are right in  your claim.[23]
But if you are unable to do so, and you can never do so, then fear the  Hell fire, whose fuel is men and stones which is prepared for the unbelievers.[24]
Give glad tidings to those who believe in this Book and do good deeds in accordance  with its teachings that for them there will be Gardens beneath which rivers flow.  Whenever they will be given fruits to eat they will say: "This is similar to the one we  used to eat before on earth," for the fruits will resemble the fruits on the earth for their  easy identification and enjoyment; and for them there will be chaste virgin spouses,  and they shall live therein for ever.[25]
Allah does not mind using the similitude of a gnat or an even more insignificant  creature to teach a lesson. Those who believe, know that it is the truth from their  Lord; but the unbelievers say: "What does Allah mean by such a similitude?" By such  a similitude Allah confounds many and enlightens many. He confounds none except  the transgressors:[26]
those who break Allah’s Covenant after accepting it, and who  cut aside what Allah has ordered to be united and cause mischief on earth. It is they  who are the losers.[27]
How can you deny Allah? Did He not give you life when you were lifeless; and will He  not cause you to die and again bring you to life; and will you not ultimately return to  Him ?[28]
It is He Who has created for you all that there is in the earth; and directed  Himself towards the sky and fashioned it into seven heavens. He has perfect  knowledge of everything.[29]
Note that occasion, when your Lord said to the angels: I am going to place a  vicegerent on earth. They said: "Will You place there one who will make mischief and  shed blood while we sing Your praises and glorify Your name?" Allah said: "I know  what you know not."[30]
He taught Adam the names of all things; then He presented the things to the angels  and said: "Tell Me the names of these if what you say is true?"[31]
Glory to You,  they replied, "we have no knowledge except what You have taught us: in fact You are  the One who is perfect in knowledge and wisdom."[32]
Allah said: "O Adam! Tell  them the names." When Adam told them the names, Allah said: "Did I not tell you  that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth and I know what you reveal and  what you conceal?"[33]
When We ordered the angels: "Prostrate before Adam in respect," they all prostrated  except Iblees (Satan) who refused in his arrogance and became a disbeliever.[34]
To  Adam We said: "Dwell with your wife in Paradise and eat anything you want from its  bountiful food from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or you shall  both become transgressors."[35]
But Satan tempted them with the tree to disobey Allah’s commandment and caused  them to be expelled from Paradise, and We said: "Get out from here, some of you  being enemies to others, and there is for you in the earth an abode and provisions for  a specified period."[36]
Then Adam received appropriate words from his Lord and repented, and Allah  accepted his repentance. Surely He is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.[37]
Get down from here all of you, We said at the time of Adam’s departure from  Paradise. "Henceforth there shall come to you guidance from Me, those who accept  and follow it shall have nothing to fear or to regret.[38]
But those who reject and defy  Our revelations will be inmates of Hellfire, wherein they shall live forever."[39]
O children of Israel! Remember My favors which I bestowed upon you; fulfill your  covenant with Me and I will fulfill My covenant with you, that you should fear none but  Me.[40]
Believe in My revelations, which are confirming your scriptures; do not be the  first one to deny My revelations, and do not sell them for a petty price, fear Me and  Me Alone.[41]
Do not mix the Truth with falsehood, or knowingly conceal the  truth.[42]
Establish Salah (prayers); give Zakah (charity); and bow down with those  who bow down in worship.[43]
Would you ask others to be righteous and forget to practice it yourselves? Even  though you read your Holy Book? Have you no sense? [44]
Seek Allah’s help with patience and Salah; it is indeed hard except for those who fear  Allah,[45]
who are certain in their mind that they are going to meet their Lord and that  they are going to return to Him for final judgment.[46]
O’ Children of Israel! Remember My favors which I bestowed upon You; that I exalted  you above all other nations.[47]
Guard yourselves against the Day on which one soul  shall not avail another - no intercession shall be accepted, no ransom shall be taken  and no help shall be given.[48]
Remember how We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they had subjected  you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your daughters; you were facing  a tremendous trial from your Lord.[49]
And We parted the Sea for you, taking you to  safety, and drowned Pharoah’s people before your very eyes.[50]
Remember when We communed with Moses for forty nights and in his absence you  took the calf for worship, thus committing a wicked transgression.[51]
Even then We  forgave you, so that you might become grateful.[52]
We gave Moses the Holy Book (Torah) and the criterion of right and wrong so that  you might be rightly guided.[53]
Remember when Moses returned with the Divine  Book, he said to his people: "O my people! You have indeed grievously wronged  yourselves by taking the calf for worship; so turn in repentance to your Creator and  slay the culprits among you; that will be best for you in His sight." He accepted your  repentance; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.[54]
Remember when you said: "O Moses! We shall never believe you until we see Allah  with our own eyes," a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on and you fell  dead.[55]
Then We raised you up after your death; so that you might be grateful.[56]
And We even provided you the shade of clouds and sent down to you manna and  salva) saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you;" in spite of these  favors your forefathers violated our commandments. However, by violating our  commandments they did not harm Us, but they harmed their own souls.[57]
Remember when We said: "Enter this town and eat whatever you wish to your heart's  content; make your way through the gates, with humility saying; ‘we repent.' We shall  forgive you your sins and We shall increase the provisions for the righteous among  you.[58]
But the wrongdoers changed Our Words from that which they were asked to  say, so We sent down a scourge from heaven as a punishment for their  transgression.[59]
Remember the time when Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: "Strike the  rock with your staff." Thereupon twelve springs came out of it. Each tribe was  assigned its own drinking-place. Then they were commanded: "Eat and drink of what  Allah has provided and do not create mischief in the land."[60]
Remember when you said: "O Moses! We cannot endure one kind of food; call on  your Lord to give us a variety of food which the earth produces, such as green-herbs,  cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions." ‘What?’ Moses asked. ‘Would you exchange  the better for the worse? If that’s what you want, go back to some city; there you will  find what you have asked for. Gradually they became so degraded that shame and  misery were brought upon them and they drew upon themselves the wrath of Allah;  this was because they went on rejecting the commandments of Allah and killed His  prophets unjustly, furthermore, it was the consequence of their disobedience and  transgression.[61]
Rest assured that Believers (Muslims), Jews, Christians and Sabians - whoever  believes in Allah and the Last Day and performs good deeds - will be rewarded by  their Lord; they will have nothing to fear or to regret.[62]
Remember O Children of Israel when We took a covenant from you and when We  lifted the Mount (Tur) over your heads saying: "Hold firmly to what We have given  you (Torah) and follow the commandments therein, so that you may guard yourself  against evil."[63]
But even after that you backed out; if there would not have been the  Grace and Mercy of Allah upon you, you surely would have been among the  losers.[64]
You very well know the story of those of you who transgressed in the matter of the  Sabbath; We ordered them: "Be detested apes".[65]
Thus, We made their fate an  example to their own people and to succeeding generations, and a lesson to those  who are God-conscious.[66]
Remember the incident when Moses said to his people: "Allah commands you to  sacrifice a cow," they replied, "do you ridicule us?" Moses answered, "I seek the  protection of Allah from being one of the ignorant."[67]
Request your Lord, they  said, "to give us some details of that cow." Moses replied: "Allah says, the cow  should neither be too old nor too young but of middle age;" do, therefore, what you  are commanded![68]
Request your Lord again they said, "to clarify for us her color."  Moses replied: "Allah says, the said cow should be of a rich and deep yellow color  pleasing to the eyes."[69]
Again they said: "Request your Lord to clarify for us the  exact type of cow she should be, for to us all cows look alike; if Allah wills, we shall  be rightly guided."[70]
Moses replied: "Allah says, the said cow should have neither  been used to till the soil nor water the fields; a healthy one free from any blemish."  "Now you have brought us the accurate description," they said. Then they  slaughtered her, after they had nearly declined.[71]
And remember the incident when you killed a man and started disputing as to who  killed him, Allah made it known what you concealed.[72]
So We said: "Strike the  dead body with a piece of the slaughtered cow." That’s how Allah brought the dead to  life to show you His Signs so that you may understand His power to restore life.[73]
But even after seeing that your hearts became hard like a rock or even harder, for  there are some rocks from which rivers gush out, and there are some which break  asunder and water comes out of them, and there are some which fall down with the  fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.[74]
Do you, O Believers, still hope that they (people of the Book) will believe in what you  say, when some of them have already heard the word of Allah and perverted it  knowingly after they understood it?[75]
When they meet the believers (Muslims) they  say: "We too are believers," but when they (people of the Book) meet each other in  private, they say: "Would you disclose to the believers (Muslims) what Allah has  revealed to you? So that they (Muslims) may use it as an argument against you in  the court of your Lord? Have you no sense?"[76]
Do they not really know that Allah  knows what they conceal and what they reveal?[77]
Among them there are some illiterates who do not know their Holy Book; they follow  their own desires and do nothing but conjecture.[78]
Woe to those who write the  Book with their own hands and then say: "This is from Allah," so that they may sell it  for a petty price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for  what they have earned.[79]
The Jews say: "The fire shall not touch us except for a few days." Ask them: "Have  you obtained such a promise from Allah which He would not break ? Or do you  assert against Allah what you do not know?"[80]
Yea! Those who commit evil and  become encircled in sin are the inmates of Hellfire; they shall live there for ever.[81]
As for those who believe and do good deeds, they will be the residents of Paradise  and live there forever.[82]
Remember, We took a covenant (firm commitment) from the children of Israel: "You  shall worship none but Allah; be good to your parents, relatives, orphans and  destitute, speak fair to the people, establish 'Salah', and pay 'Zakah.'" But you broke  the covenant, except a few of you, and you paid no heed.[83]
Also remember another covenant which We took from you: That you shall not shed  blood among yourselves and you shall not expel your own people from your homes;  you confirmed it and you are witness to it.[84]
Yet there you are, killing your own  people, expelling a group amongst you from their homes, backing each other with sin  and aggression; and if they come to you as captives, you trade them for ransoms  whereas their expulsion was unlawful for you to begin with. Do you believe in a part  of your Holy Book and reject the rest? So what other punishment do such people  among you, who behave like this, deserve, than disgrace in this world and to be  driven to grievous punishment on the Day of Judgment? Allah is not unaware of what  you do.[85]
Such are the people who trade the life of this world at the expense of the  Hereafter; so neither their punishment shall be lightened nor shall they be  helped.[86]
To Moses We gave the Book (Torah) and sent after him other Messengers in  succession; then We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear Signs and strengthened him  with the Holy Spirit (Gabriel). Why is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger  with a message which did not suit your desires, you became so arrogant that to some  of them you called impostors and others you killed![87]
They say: "Our hearts are in  secure wrappers;" but the fact of the matter is that Allah has cursed them for their  disbelief, so little is that which they believe.[88]
Now when there has come to them a Book from Allah confirming the Holy Books of  Torah and Gospel which they already have - even though before this they used to  pray for victory against the unbelievers - when there came to them that which they  very well recognize, they knowingly rejected it; Allah’s curse is on such  disbelievers.[89]
Ridiculous is the price for which they have sold away their souls,  that they deny Allah’s revelation merely because of their grudge, that Allah should  send His grace (on an Israelite rather than) on whom He pleases from His servants  (Muhammad)! They have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath, and for such  disbelievers there is a disgraceful punishment.[90]
When they are asked to believe in what Allah has revealed, they reply: "We only  believe in what Allah has sent to us (Torah), and we reject what is beside that," while  it is the truth confirming their own scriptures! Well, ask them, "If you sincerely believe  in what was sent to you , why did you kill the Prophets of Allah who were sent to you  from amongst yourselves before?"[91]
Moses came to you with clear Signs, no  sooner was he away from you, than you committed evil by worshipping the calf.[92]
Remember when We took a Covenant from you and We lifted the Mount of Tur over  your heads saying: "Take what We have given you firmly and listen to Our  Commandments," you replied: "we have heard but we will not obey." So much was  the love of that calf in their hearts due to their unbelief. Tell them: "If you are real  believers, then why does your faith prompt you to do such evil things?"[93]
Say O Muhammad: "If the Home of the Hereafter is exclusively for you and not for  the rest of mankind, then wish for death if you are true in your claim!"[94]
But they  will never wish for death, because they are fully aware of the consequences of what  they have sent before them for the Hereafter. And Allah knows the mentality of the  wrongdoers.[95]
You will find them the greediest of men for life, even greedier than  the pagans; each one of them wishes to be given a life of a thousand years; but the  grant of such a life will not save them from the punishment, for Allah is watching  whatever they do.[96]
Say O Muhammad: "Whoever is the enemy of Jibra'el (Gabriel) should know that he  revealed this Qur'an to your heart by Allah’s command, which confirms previous  scriptures, and is a guidance and good news for the believers."[97]
Let them know  that whoever is an enemy to Allah, His angels, His Messengers, Jibra'el (Gabriel) and  Mika‘el (Michael); Allah is an enemy to such unbelievers.[98]
We have sent down to you clear revelations: no one can deny them except the  transgressors.[99]
Has it not been the case that every time they made a covenant a  group of them threw it aside? But the fact is that most of them are faithless.[100]
Whenever there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming their own Holy  Book, a group from those to whom the Holy book were given cast off the Book of  Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing about it,[101]
and accepted what the  Satans falsely attributed to the kingdom of Solomon; not that Solomon was an  unbeliever, it was the Satans who were unbelievers; they taught witchcraft to the  people and that which was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut in the city of  Babylon. Yet, these two angels never taught magic to anyone without saying: "We  have been sent to tempt you; do not renounce your faith." In spite of this warning,  those people kept on learning from the angels, the magic of which could cause  discord between husband and wife; although they could harm none with it except  with Allah’s permission. They learned, indeed, what harmed them and did not profit  them; even though they knew fully well that the buyers of magic would have no share  in the happiness of the Hereafter. Surely, they sold their souls for a bad price, if they  could understand it![102]
If they would have believed (accepted Islam) and kept  themselves away from evil, there would have been a better reward from Allah, if they  could understand it![103]
O Believers, do not say to our Messenger: "Ra'ina" (an ambiguous word for: "Listen,  may you become deaf" or "Our shepherd" or in Judeo-Arabic language conveys the  sense, "our evil one.") But say "Unzurna" ("look upon" us "or pay attention" to us) and  listen to him carefully; and remember that there is a painful punishment for the  unbelievers.[104]
The unbelievers among the People of the Book, and the pagans,  would never wish that any good be sent down to you, O Muhammad, from your Lord,  but Allah chooses for His special Mercy whom He pleases, and Allah is the most  Gracious.[105]
We do not abrogate any of Our verses of the Qur'an or cause it to be forgotten  except that We substitute it with something better or similar; don't you know that Allah  has full power over everything?[106]
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the  dominion of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah, you have no protector  or helper![107]
Do you intend to ask questions from your Messenger (Muhammad) as Moses was  questioned before? But whoever barters belief for unbelief, has indeed lost the  direction of the Right Way.[108]
Many among the people of the Book (Jews and Christians) wish they could somehow  turn you back to unbelief, due to their selfish envy, after the truth has become quite  clear to them. Forgive them and bear with them until Allah brings about His decision;  rest assured that Allah has power over everything.[109]
Establish Salah and pay Zakah, and whatever good you send ahead of you to the  Hereafter for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah is watching all your  actions.[110]
They say: "None shall enter paradise except the one who is a Jew or a Christian."  These are their vain desires. Say O Muhammad: "Let us have your proof if you are  right in your claim."[111]
Yea! Whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and is good  to others will be rewarded by his Lord; and will have nothing to fear or to regret.[112]
The Jews say: "The Christians are not on the right track," and the Christians say: "It  is the Jews who are not on the right track," yet both read their Holy Books (Torah or  Gospel). And those who have no knowledge (the pagan Arabs) say like to what both  of them say; so Allah will judge between them in their dispute on the Day of  Judgment.[113]
Who is more unjust than the one who prevents people from the Masajid (place of  worship) of Allah , forbids the mention of His name therein, and strives to ruin them ?  It is not proper for such people to enter in them except with His fear. For them there  is disgrace in this world and grievous punishment in the Hereafter.[114]
To Allah belong the East and the West; whichever direction you turn your face there  is the presence of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Embracing and All-Knowing.[115]
They say: "Allah has taken to Himself a son;" Allah is above such things! Rather, to  Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; all are obedient to Him.*
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth ! When He decrees a thing, He needs only to say, "Be," and there it becomes.
Those who have no knowledge ask: "Why does Allah not speak to us face to face or  send us a sign ?" The same demand was made by those before them: they all have  the same mentality. We have already shown clear signs to those whose faith is  firm.[118]
What clearer sign could there be than this Book? We have sent you (O  Muhammad) with the knowledge of the Truth and made you the bearer of good news  and warning; now, you will not be called upon to answer about the actions of the  companions of the blazing fire.[119]
The Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you, until you follow their  faith. O Muhammad, tell them : "Allah’s guidance is the only guidance;" and if after all  the knowledge you have received, you yield to their desires, there shall be none to  protect you or help you from the wrath of Allah.[120]
Those to whom We have given  the book and who read it as it ought to be read, they are the ones who believe in it;  as for those who reject it, they are for sure the losers.[121]
O Children of Israel! Remember the special favor which I bestowed upon you; that I  exalted you above all other nations.[122]
Guard yourselves against the Day when  one soul shall not avail another, no ransom shall be taken, no intercession shall profit  anyone, and no help shall be given.[123]
Remember when Abraham was tested by his Lord with certain commands, he fulfilled  them. Allah said: "Surely, I will make you the leader of mankind." "What about my  offspring?" Asked Abraham. "My pledge," said Allah, "will not apply to the evil  doers."[124]
Remember when We made the House (the Ka'bah) a center and sanctuary for  mankind saying, "Take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer;" We entrusted  Abraham and Isma‘il to cleanse Our House for those who walk around it, who  meditate in it, and who kneel and prostrate in prayers.[125]
Abraham said: "My Lord,  make this (Mecca) a secure town and provide its people with plenty of food from  fruits, those of them who believe in Allah and the Last Day." He answered, "As for  those who do not, I shall also provide for them in this life, though in the Hereafter I  shall drag them to the torture of Hellfire and it is an evil destination indeed!"[126]
Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House and dedicated it by  saying: "Accept this from us, O Lord, You are the one who hears all and knows  all.[127]
O Lord, make us both Muslims (submissive to You); and make our  descendants a nation that will be Muslims (submissive to You). Teach us our rites of  worship and forbear our shortcomings; surely, You are the Acceptor of repentance,  the Merciful.[128]
O Lord, appoint from among them a Messenger who shall recite to  them Your Revelations and teach them the Book and the Wisdom and sanctify them;  surely, You are the All-Mighty, the Wise."[129]
Who but a foolish man would renounce the faith of Abraham? We chose him in this  worldly life, while in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous.[130]
When his  Lord asked him: "Be a Muslim," he answered: "I have become a Muslim to the Lord  of the worlds."[131]
This was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons and so did  Jacob, when he said: "O my sons! Allah has chosen for you this Deen (way of life),  therefore, die not unless you are Muslims."[132]
Were you present when death approached Jacob? He asked his sons: "Who will you  worship after me?" They replied: "We will worship the same One God Who is your  Lord and the Lord of your forefathers Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, and to Him we all  submit as Muslims."[133]
They were a people that have passed away. They shall reap the fruits of what they  did, and you shall for what you do. You shall not be questioned about what they  did.[134]
Jews and Christians say: "Be Jews or Christians, you shall then be rightly  guided." O Muhammad, say: "By no means! We follow the faith of Abraham, the  upright one; and he was not one of the pagans."[135]
Say: "We believe in Allah and that which is revealed to us; and what was revealed to  Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants, and that which was given to  Moses, Jesus and other Prophets from their Lord. We do not discriminate any of  them, and to Allah we have surrendered ourselves (in Islam)."[136]
So, if they accept  Islam like you, they shall be rightly guided; if they reject it, they will surely fall into  dissension (divide into differing factions); Allah will be your sufficient defender against  them, and He hears and knows everything.[137]
Baptism is from Allah; and who is better than Allah in baptizing? Him do we  worship.[138]
Say, O Muhammad: "Would you dispute with us concerning Allah, who is our Lord  and your Lord as well? We shall be accountable to Him for our deeds and you for  yours; to Him Alone we are devoted.[139]
Do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael,  Isaac, Jacob and their descendants were all Jews or Christians? Are you more  knowledgeable than Allah?" Who is more wicked than the one who hides the  testimony received from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do.[140]
That was a  nation who has already passed away. They are responsible for what they did and you  are for what you do, you shall not be questioned about their deeds.[141]
The foolish will ask: "Why did they turn away from the Qiblah (the direction in prayer)  towards which they used to face?" O Muhammad, say: "East and West belong to  Allah; He guides whomever He wishes to the Right Way."[142]
We have made you a moderate Ummah (nation) so that you may testify against  mankind and that your own Messenger may testify against you. We decreed your  former Qiblah only to distinguish those who are the real followers of the Messenger  from those who would back away from the faith. It was indeed a hard test except for  those whom Allah has guided. Allah wants not to make your faith fruitless. Allah is  Compassionate and Merciful to mankind.[143]
O Muhammad, many a time We noticed you turning your face towards heaven; now  We will make you turn towards a Qiblah that will please you. Turn your face during  Salah towards the Sacred Mosque (Ka'bah); wherever you are turn your face in that  direction. The people of the Book know this to be the truth from their Lord. Allah is  not unaware of what they do.[144]
Even if you give every proof to the people of the  Book, they will not accept your Qiblah, nor will you accept theirs. Neither of them (the  Jews and Christians) are the followers of each other’s Qiblah. If, after all the  knowledge you have been given, you yield to their desires then surely you will be  among the wrongdoers.[145]
Those to whom We have given the Book (Jews and  Christians) recognize this fact as they recognize their own children.[146]
Nevertheless, a group of them deliberately conceal the truth. The truth is from your  Lord; therefore, you should never be among the doubters.[147]
Everyone has a direction towards which one turns, therefore, emulate one another in  good deeds. Wherever you are, Allah will bring all of you together; Allah has power  over all things.[148]
From whatever place you come forth, turn your face during  Salah towards the Sacred Mosque; this is in fact a commandment from your Lord.  Allah is not unaware of what you do.[149]
Again, whatever place you come forth, turn  your face during Salah towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you are, face  towards it, so that people will not have any argument against you, except those  among them who are wrongdoers. Do not fear them; fear Me, so that I may perfect  My favors to you and that you may be rightly guided,[150]
just as We bestowed Our  favor upon you when We sent among you a Messenger of your own who recites to  you Our revelations, sanctifies you, teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches  you that which you did not know.[151]
Therefore, remember Me, and, I will remember  you, be grateful to Me and never deny Me.[152]
O’ You who believe! Seek My help with patience and prayer: surely, Allah is with  those who are patient.[153]
Do not say about those who are slain in the cause of Allah (martyrs), that they are  dead. Nay, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.[154]
We shall surely test your steadfastness with fear and famine, with loss of property,  life and produce. Give good news to those who endure with patience;[155]
who,  when afflicted with calamity, say: "We belong to Allah and to Him we shall  return."[156]
Such are the people on whom there are blessings and Mercy from  Allah; and they are the ones that are rightly guided.[157]
Behold! Safa and Marwah (two hills in the Sacred Mosque) are among the symbols  of Allah. So anyone who performs Hajj or Umrah (pilgrimage) to the House, there is  no blame if one goes around both of them; and anyone who does good voluntarily  should know that surely Allah knows the grateful.[158]
Those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance, after We have made it clear in  the Book for mankind will have Allah's curse and that of those who are entitled to  curse;[159]
except those who repent, reform and let the truth be known; I will accept  their repentance, for I am the Receiver of Repentance, the Merciful.[160]
Surely  those who are unbelievers and die while they are unbelievers, they are the ones on  whom is the curse of Allah, the angels and all mankind,[161]
they will live in it for  ever; neither their punishment shall be lightened nor shall they be given respite.[162]
Your God is one God; there is no one worthy of worship except Him, the  Compassionate, the Merciful.[163]
Surely, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, in the alternation of the night  and the day, in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the profit of mankind, in  the rain which Allah sends down from the skies, with which He revives the earth after  its death and spreads in it all kinds of animals, in the change of the winds and the  clouds between the sky and the earth that are made subservient, there are signs for  rational people.[164]
There are some who worship other deities besides Allah (pagans), they love them as  they should love Allah, whereas the believers are strong in love for Allah. If those  who are unjust could visualize (the Day of Judgement) when they will see the  chastisement, they would come to know for sure that all powers belong to Allah and  that Allah is stern in retribution.[165]
On that Day those leaders who were being  followed, when faced with their punishment, will renounce those who followed them  and the bonds which united them will break asunder.[166]
The followers will say: "If it  could be possible for us to live again, we would renounce them as they have  renounced us today." Thus Allah will show them the fruits of their deeds. They will  sigh with regret, and shall not be able to come out of the Hell fire.[167]
O Mankind! Eat of what is lawful and clean on the earth and do not follow the  footsteps of Satan, surely he is your open enemy.[168]
He enjoins you to commit evil  and indecency and to say certain things against Allah about which you have no  knowledge.[169]
When it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has revealed." They reply: "Nay! We will  follow what our forefathers practiced." Well! Even if their forefathers had no sense at  all and lacked guidance?[170]
The parable of those who reject faith is like cattle  which, call out to them as one may, hear nothing but a shout and a cry since they are  unable to understand; they are deaf, dumb and blind, and understand nothing.[171]
O believers! Eat the clean things which We have provided you and give thanks to  Allah, if you worship only Him.[172]
He has forbidden you to eat dead meat, blood,  the flesh of swine, and that on which any name other than Allah has been invoked;  but if someone is compelled by absolute necessity, intending neither to sin nor to  transgress, they shall incur no sin. Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[173]
Surely those who conceal any part of the Book which Allah has revealed and sell His  revelations for a petty price (material gain), shall swallow nothing but fire into their  bellies. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will neither speak to them nor purify them  and they shall have painful punishment.[174]
These are the kind of people who  barter guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment. How stubborn are they to  encounter Hell fire![175]
Their doom is because Allah has revealed the Book with the  truth; surely those who seek causes of dispute in the Book (the Qur'an) are in  extreme schism (divergence).[176]
Righteousness is not whether you turn your face towards East or West; but  righteousness is to believe in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Books and the  Prophets, and to spend wealth out of love for Him on relatives, orphans, helpless,  needy travellers, those who ask for and on the redemption of captives; and to  establish Salah (prayers), to pay Zakah (alms), to fulfill promises when made, to be  steadfast in distress, in adversity, and at the time of war. These people are the  truthful and these are the pious.[177]
O believers! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the cases of murder: a free man for a  free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if anyone is pardoned by  his aggrieved brother, then bloodwit (a ransom for manslaughter) should be decided  according to the common law and payment should be made with gratitude. This is a  concession and a mercy from your Lord. Now, whoever exceeds the limits after this,  shall have a painful punishment.[178]
O men of understanding! There is security of  life for you in the law of retaliation, so that you may learn self-restraint. [179]
The will is made obligatory before the death of anyone of you who is leaving some  property behind to bequest it equitably to his parents and relatives. This is a duty  incumbent on the righteous.[180]
If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the  sin of it then is on those who make the change. Allah hears and knows  everything.[181]
But there is no blame on the one who suspects an error or an  injustice on the part of the testator and brings about a settlement among the parties.  Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[182]
O believers! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you  so that you may learn self-restraint.[183]
Fast the prescribed number of days; except  if any of you is ill or on a journey, then fast a similar number of days later. For those  who can not endure it for medical reasons, there is a ransom: the feeding of one poor  person for each missed day. Whoever does more good than this voluntarily, it is  better for him. However, if you truly understand the rationale of fasting, it is better for  you to fast.[184]
It is the month of Ramadhan in which the Qur’an was revealed, a guidance for  mankind with clear teachings showing the Right Way and a criterion of truth and  falsehood. Therefore, anyone of you who witnesses that month should fast therein,  and whoever is ill or upon a journey shall fast a similar number of days later on. Allah  intends your well-being and does not want to put you to hardship. He wants you to  complete the prescribed period so that you should glorify His Greatness and render  thanks to Him for giving you guidance.[185]
When my servants question you about Me, tell them that I am very close to them. I  answer the prayer of every suppliant when he calls Me; therefore, they should  respond to Me and put their trust in Me, so that they may be rightly guided.[186]
It is made lawful for you to approach your wives during the night of the fast; they are  an apparel for you and you for them. Allah knows that you were committing  dishonesty to your souls. So He has relented towards you and pardoned you. Now,  you may approach and seek what Allah has written for you. Eat and drink until the  white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread of night, then  complete your fast till nightfall. Do not approach your wives during I‘htikaf (retreat in  the mosques in last ten days of Ramadhan). These are the limits set by Allah: do not  ever violate them. Thus Allah makes His revelations clear to mankind so that they  may guard themselves against evil.[187]
Do not misappropriate one another’s property unjustly, nor bribe the judges, in order  to misappropriate a part of other people’s property, sinfully and knowingly.[188]
They question you about the new moon. Tell them: it is to determine the periods of  time for the benefit of mankind and for the Hajj (pilgrimage). It is not righteous to  enter your houses from the back doors during Hajj times. Righteousness is to fear  Allah. Enter your houses through the proper doors and fear Allah so that you may  prosper.[189]
Fight in the cause of Allah with those who fight against you, but do not exceed the  limits. Allah does not like transgressors.[190]
Kill them wherever they confront you in  combat and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you. Though  killing is bad, creating mischief is worse than killing. Do not fight them within the  precincts of the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there; but if they attack you,  put them to the sword; that is the punishment for such unbelievers.[191]
If they cease  hostility, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[192]
Fight against them until there is  no more disorder and Allah’s supremacy is established. If they desist, let there be no  hostility except against the oppressors.[193]
The Sacred month, in which fighting is prohibited, is to be respected if the same is  respected by the enemy: sacred things too are subject to retaliation. Therefore, if  anyone transgresses a prohibition and attacks you, retaliate with the same force.  Fear Allah, and bear in mind that Allah is with the righteous.[194]
Give generously for the cause of Allah and do not cast yourselves into destruction by  your own hands. Be charitable: Allah loves those who are charitable.[195]
Complete the Hajj (obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca) and the Umrah (optional visit to  Mecca) for the sake of Allah. If you are prevented from proceeding then send such  offering for sacrifice as you can afford and do not shave your head until the offerings  have reached their destination. But if any of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp  which necessitates shaving, he must pay ransom either by fasting or feeding the poor  or offering a sacrifice. If in peacetime anyone wants to take the advantage of  performing Umrah and Hajj' together, he should make an offering which he can  afford; but if he lack the means, let him fast three days during the Hajj and seven  days on his return making ten days in all. This order is for the one whose household  is not in the precincts of the Sacred Mosque. Fear Allah and know that Allah is strict  in retribution.[196]
Hajj is in the well known months. One who undertakes to perform it must abstain  from husband-wife relationship, obscene language, and wrangling during Hajj.  Whatever good you do, Allah knows it. Take necessary provisions with you for the  journey, and piety is the best provision of all. Fear Me, O People endowed with  understanding.[197]
There is no blame on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord  during this journey. When you return from Arafat, (stop at Muzdalifah and) praise  Allah near Mash‘ar-al-Har’am. Praise Him as He has guided you, for before this you  were from the people who had lost the Right Way.[198]
Then return from where the  others return and ask Allah’s forgiveness; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[199]
When you have fulfilled your sacred duties, praise Allah as you used to praise your  forefathers or with deeper reverence. There are some who say: "Our Lord! Give us  abundance in this world." Such people will not have any share in the hereafter.[200]
But there are others who say: "Our Lord! Give us the good life, both in this world and  in the Hereafter and save us from the torment of the fire."[201]
Such people shall  have their due share in both worlds according to what they have earned, Allah is swift  in settling all accounts.[202]
Celebrate the praises of Allah during these appointed  days. If anyone hastens to leave Mina after two days or stays there a day longer  there is no blame on him provided he spends these days in piety. Fear Allah and  remember that you will surely be gathered before Him.[203]
Among the people there is one whose speech fascinates you in this worldly life; he  may even call upon Allah to witness what is in his heart, yet he is your staunch  opponent.[204]
And when he leaves you, he directs his efforts towards causing  mischief in the land, destroying crops and cattle. Allah, Whom he makes his witness,  does not like mischief.[205]
When it is said to him "Fear Allah," arrogance carries him  off to sin. Hell will be the proper place for such a person, which is indeed an evil  refuge.[206]
And among people there is one who would give away his life to seek the  pleasure of Allah. Allah is affectionate to His devotees.[207]
O believers enter into Islam completely and do not follow the footsteps of Satan,  surely he is your clear-cut enemy.[208]
If you falter after receiving the clear-cut  message, then keep in mind that Allah is Mighty, Wise.[209]
Are they waiting for  Allah to come down to them in the shadow of clouds, along with the angels and make  His decision known? Ultimately, all matters will be presented to Allah for  decision.[210]
Ask the Children of Israel how many clear-cut signs We have given them. Anyone  who substitutes the favor of Allah (changes the revelations of Allah) after it has come  to him, should know that Allah is strict in retribution.[211]
The life of this world is  charming to those who are unbelievers and they mock at those who believe, but they  forget that those who fear Allah will rank above them on the Day of Resurrection;  Allah gives sustenance without measure to whom He wants.[212]
Mankind was one nation having one religion. Later when people invented other  religions, Allah appointed Prophets as bearers of good news and warnings; and  revealed to them the Book with the True Guidance to settle the matters of dispute  between mankind. But the very people to whom it was given, started disputes after  the clear arguments had come to them, because of rivalry between one another.  Allah has guided the believers by His will to the truth in those matters in which they  had differences. Allah guides whom He pleases towards the Right Way.[213]
Do you think that you will enter Paradise without any trials while you have known the  examples of those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with suffering  and adversity and were so violently shaken up that even the Messenger and the  believers with him cried out: "When will Allah’s help come?" Then they were  comforted with the words, Be aware! Allah’s help is ever close.[214]
They ask you what they should spend in charity. Say: "Whatever you spend with a  good heart, give it to parents, relatives, orphans, the helpless, and travellers in need.  Whatever good you do, Allah is aware of it.[215]
Fighting has been made obligatory  for you, much to your dislike. It is quite possible that something which you don’t like is  good for you and that something which you love is bad for you. Allah knows, and you  do not.[216]
They ask you about war in the Sacred Month. Tell them: "Fighting in this month is a  heinous offence; but to prevent from the path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent  access and expel His worshippers from the Sacred Mosque is a more severe crime,  since mischief is worse than killing in His sight. As for unbelievers: they will not cease  fighting until they succeed in turning you back from your religion if they can; and if  any of you turns back from his religion and dies as an unbeliever, his deeds will  become void in this life and in the hereafter. He will be the inmate of the hellfire, to  live in there forever.[217]
Surely those who are believers, and migrated and  struggled in the path of Allah, they can hope for the mercy of Allah; and Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful."[218]
They ask you about drinking and gambling. Tell them: "There is great sin in both,  although they may have some benefit for men; but the sin is greater than the benefit."  They ask you what they should spend; tell them: "Whatever you can." Thus Allah  makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may reflect upon[219]
this world and  the hereafter. They ask you about orphans. Tell them: "It is best to deal with them  justly; you may become copartners with them, after all they are your brethren; Allah  knows who means harm and also who means their welfare. If Allah had wanted He  could be hard on you in this matter, surely Allah is Mighty, Wise."[220]
Do not marry pagan women until they become believers; a believing slave woman is  better than a free pagan woman even though she may be more attractive to you.  Likewise, do not marry pagan men until they become believers: a believing slave is  better than a free pagan even though he may be more pleasing to you. These  pagans invite you to the hellfire while Allah invites you towards paradise and  forgiveness by His grace. He makes His revelations clear to mankind so that they  may take heed.[221]
They ask you about menstruation. Tell them: "This is a discomfort; therefore, keep  away from women (do not have sexual intercourse) during their menstrual periods  and do not approach them until they are clean again. When they have cleansed  themselves then you may approach them in the manner Allah has enjoined for you.  Surely Allah loves those who turn to Him in repentance and keep themselves  clean.[222]
Your wives are your tilth; so go to your tilth when you like. Take care of  your future and refrain from the displeasure of Allah. Bear in mind that you shall meet  Him in the Hereafter, and give good news to the believers.[223]
Do not use Allah's name in your oaths as an excuse to prevent you from dealing  justly, guarding against evil and making peace between people; Allah hears and  knows everything.[224]
Allah will not hold you accountable for what is inadvertent in  your oaths, but He will hold you accountable for what you intended in your hearts;  Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.[225]
Those who renounce conjugal relationship with their wives on oath have a limitation  of four months. If they reconcile and restore their relationship, surely Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful.[226]
But if they decide to divorce them, they may do so, surely  Allah hears and knows everything.[227]
Divorced women must keep themselves waiting for three menstrual periods, it is not  lawful for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah  and the Last Day. In such cases their husbands have a right to take them back in that  period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those exercised  against them in an equitable manner, although men have a status (degree of  responsibility) above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise.[228]
The pronouncement of revocable divorce is only allowed twice: then she should be  allowed to stay with honor or let go with kindness after the third pronouncement. It is  not lawful for husbands to take anything back which they have given them except  when both parties fear that they may not be able to follow the limits set by Allah; then  if you fear that they both will not be able to keep the limits of Allah, there is no blame  if, by mutual agreement the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce. These  are the limits set by Allah; do not transgress them, and those who transgress the  limits of Allah are the wrongdoers.[229]
So if a husband divorces his wife three times,  it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and  gotten the divorced. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they reunite in  marriage, provided they think that they can keep the limits of Allah. Such are the  limits of Allah which He makes clear to the people of understanding.[230]
When you divorce women and they have reached the end of their waiting period  (‘Iddat) either allow them to stay with honor or let them go with kindness; but you  should not retain them to harm them or to take undue advantage; if anyone does that  he wrongs his own soul. Do not take Allah’s revelations as a joke. Remember the  favors of Allah upon you and the fact that He sent down the Book and Wisdom for  your guidance. Fear Allah and know that Allah has knowledge of everything.[231]
When you have divorced women and they have reached the end of their waiting  period do not prevent them from marrying their prospective husbands if they have  come to an honorable agreement. This is enjoined on everyone amongst you who  believes in Allah and the Last Day. This is more virtuous and chaste for you; Allah  knows what you do not know.[232]
The mothers shall breast-feed their offspring for two whole years if the father wishes  the breast-feeding to be completed. The reasonable cost of their maintenance and  clothing will be the responsibility of the child’s father. No one should be charged with  more than they can afford. Neither a mother should be made to suffer on account of  her child nor a father on account of his child. The father’s heirs are under the same  obligation. But if, with mutual agreement, they both decide to wean the child, there is  no blame on them. If you decide to have a foster-mother for your offspring, there is  no blame on you provided you pay what you have promised to pay in an honorable  manner. Fear Allah and beware that Allah observes your actions.[233]
As for those  of you who die and leave widows behind, let them abstain from marriage for four  months and ten days: when they have reached the end of this period, there is no  blame on you for what they do for themselves in a decent manner. Allah is aware of  what you do.[234]
There is no blame on you if you make a proposal of marriage during their waiting  period openly or keep it in your hearts. Allah knows that you will naturally cherish  them in your hearts; however, be careful not to make any secret agreement, and if  you wish to marry, speak to them in an honorable manner. Do not confirm the  marriage tie until the prescribed waiting period expires. You should know that Allah is  aware of what is in your hearts, so fear Him. Bear in mind that Allah is Forgiving,  Forbearing.[235]
There is no blame on you if you divorce women before the marriage is consummated  or the dowry is settled. Pay them something anyhow, the rich man according to his  means and poor according to his, a reasonable amount in all fairness. This is an  obligation on the righteous people.[236]
And if you divorce them before the marriage  is consummated but after the fixation of a dowry, give them half of their dowry unless  the woman wants to waive it or the man in whose hand is the marriage tie agrees to  forego (and pay the dowry in full). To forego and give full dowry is closer to piety. Do  not forget to show kindness to each other. Surely Allah observes your actions.[237]
Guard your Salah (obligatory regular prayers) especially the middle Salah and stand  up with true devotion to Allah.[238]
If you are in danger, pray on foot or while riding;  and when you are safe, remember Allah in the manner that He has taught you which  you did not know before.[239]
Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for them a year’s  maintenance without causing them to leave their homes; but if they leave the  residence on their own there is no blame on you for what they chose for themselves  in a fair way. Allah is Mighty, Wise.[240]
Reasonable provisions must also be made  for divorced women. That is an obligation upon those who fear Allah.[241]
That’s  how Allah makes His Revelations clear to you so that you may understand.[242]
Have you reflected on the case of thousands of people (Israelites) who fled their  homes for fear of death? Allah said to them: "Die" (gave them death). Then He gave  them life again. Surely Allah is bountiful to mankind, but most of the people are  ungrateful.[243]
O believers, fight in the path of Allah without fear of death and bear  in mind that Allah hears and knows everything.[244]
Who will loan to Allah a beautiful loan which Allah will increase many fold? Allah  alone can decrease and increase wealth, and to Him you all shall return.[245]
Have  you not reflected on what the leaders of the children of Israel demanded from one of  their Prophets after the death of Moses? "Appoint for us a king," they said, "and we  will fight in the cause of Allah." The Prophet replied: "What if you refuse to fight when  you are ordered to do so?" They replied, "How could we refuse to fight in the cause  of Allah, while we along with our children were driven out of our homes?" But when,  on their demand, they were ordered to fight, all refused except a few of them. Allah  knows the evildoers.[246]
Their Prophet told them: "Allah has appointed TaLut to be your king." They replied:  "How can he be our king when some of us are more deserving than him? Besides, he  is not rich." The Prophet said: "Allah has chosen him to rule over you and blessed  him with knowledge and stature. Allah grants kingship to whom He pleases and Allah  has boundless knowledge."[247]
Furthermore, their Prophet told them: "The sign of  his appointment as a king is that there will come to you the chest in which there is  tranquillity from your Lord and the residue of relics which the family of Moses and the  family of Haroon (Aaron) left behind, and that chest will be carried by the angels.  Surely therein is a sign for you if you are true believers."[248]
When TaLut marched forth with his army, he announced: "Allah will test you at a  certain river; anyone who will drink from its water shall cease to be my soldier, and  those who will not drink to quench their thirst with its water except a sip or so from  the hollow of their hands shall fight on my side." They all drank from it, inspite of this  warning, except a few of them. When he and those who believed with him crossed  the river, they said: "We have no power left this day against JaLut (Goliath) and his  warriors." But the believers, who knew they would meet Allah, replied: "It has often  happened that a small group, by the grace of Allah, has vanquished a mighty army.  Allah is with those who endure with patience."[249]
When they advanced to face JaLut (Goliath) and his warriors, they prayed: "Our Lord!  Fill our hearts with steadfastness, make our steps firm, and help us (give us victory)  against the unbelievers."[250]
By Allah’s will they put the unbelievers to flight, and  Davidkilled JaLut. Allah gave David the kingdom and wisdom and taught him what  else He pleased. If Allah had not been repelling one set of people by the might of  others, there would indeed be disorder on earth, but Allah is Gracious to all the  worlds.[251]
These are the revelations of Allah; We recite them to you in truth. Surely  you, O Muhammad, are one of Our Messengers.[252]
These are the Messengers (which We have sent for the guidance of mankind). We  have exalted some above others. To some Allah spoke directly; others He raised  high in ranks; to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear Signs and supported him with  the Holy Spirit. If Allah wanted, the people who received the clear signs would not  have fought against each other; but they disputed as a result, there were some who  believed while others rejected. Yet If Allah wanted, they would not have fought each  other; but Allah does what He intends.[253]
O believers! Spend out of the sustenance which We have provided for you before the  arrival of that Day when there will be no bargaining, friendship or intercession. It is  the unbelievers who are wrongdoers.[254]
Allah! There is no god but Him: the Living, the Eternal. He neither slumbers nor  sleeps. To Him belongs all that is in the Heavens and the Earth. Who can intercede  with Him without His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind  them. They cannot gain access to any thing out of His knowledge except what He  pleases. His throne is more vast than the heavens and the earth, and guarding of  these both does not fatigue Him. He is the Exalted, the Supreme.[255]
There is no compulsion in religion. True guidance has been made clearly distinct  from error. Therefore, whoever renounces ‘Taghut’ (forces of Satan) and believes in  Allah has grasped the firm hand-hold that will never break. Allah, Whose hand-hold  you have grasped, hears all and knows all.[256]
Allah is the Wali (Protector) of those  who believe, He brings them out of the depth of darkness and leads them into the  light. As for the unbelievers, whose wali (protector) is Taghut (forces of Satan), he  takes them out of the light and leads them into the depths of darkness. As a result  they will become the companions of the Hell fire and shall live therein forever.[257]
Have you ever reflected upon the one, to whom Allah had given a kingdom, who  argued with Abraham about his Lord. When Abraham said: "My Lord is He Who has  power to give life and to cause death." He replied: "I too have the power to give life  and to cause death." Abraham said: "Well, Allah causes the sun to rise from the east;  just make it rise from the west." Thus the unbeliever was confounded; Allah does not  guide the evildoers.[258]
Or take another example of the one (Prophet Ezra) who passed by a town which had  fallen down upon its roofs. He exclaimed: "How can Allah bring this dead township  back to life?" Thereupon Allah caused him to die, and after one hundred years  brought him back to life. Allah asked: "How long did you remain here?" Ezra replied:  "Perhaps a day or part of a day." Allah said: "Nay! You have remained here for one  hundred years: now just have a look at your food and drink; they are not rotten; and  then look at your donkey and see that his very bones have decayed. We have done  this to make you a Sign for mankind. Look at the bones of your donkey how We bring  them together then clothe them with flesh and bring him back to life! When this all  was shown clearly to him he said: "Now I know that Allah has power over  everything."[259]
Yet another example is when Abraham said: "My Lord! Show me how you give life to  the dead." He replied: "Have you no faith in this?" Abraham humbly submitted: "Yes!  But I ask this to reassure my heart." Allah said: "Take four birds; train them to follow  your direction, cut their bodies into pieces and scatter those pieces on hilltops, then  call them back; Allah will bring them back to life and they will come to you right away.  Thus you will know that Allah is All-powerful and Wise."[260]
The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is that of a grain that  sprouts into seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains. Allah gives manifold  increase to whom He wishes. Allah has boundless knowledge.[261]
Those who  spend their wealth in the cause of Allah and do not follow their charity with reminders  of their generosity or injure the feeling of the recipient, shall get their reward from  their Lord; they shall have nothing to fear or to regret.[262]
Kind words and  forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. Allah is Self-sufficient,  Forbearing.[263]
O believers! Do not make your charity worthless by reminders of your generosity or  by injury to the recipients feelings, like those who spend their wealth to be seen by  people and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. Their parable is like a hard  barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil; a heavy rain falls, leaving it just a bare  stone. Such people will not gain any reward that they thought they had earned. Allah  does not guide the unbelievers.[264]
The example of those who spend their wealth to seek the pleasure of Allah and to  strengthen their souls is like a garden on a high and fertile ground: when heavy rain  falls on it, it yields up twice its normal produce; and if no rain falls, even a light  moisture is sufficient. Whatever you do is in the sight of Allah.[265]
Would any one of  you like that his garden, which is full of palm trees, grape vines, and all kinds of fruits  and watered by running streams, be blasted and consumed by a fiery whirlwind at  the time when he has become too old and his children are too feeble to earn  anything? Thus Allah makes His revelations clear to you so that you may ponder  over them.[266]
O believers, spend in Allah’s Way the best portion of the wealth you have lawfully  earned and that which We have produced for you from the earth, and do not pick out  for charity those worthless things that you yourselves would not accept but with  closed eyes. Bear in mind that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.[267]
Satan  threatens you with poverty and prompts you to commit what is indecent, while Allah  promises you His forgiveness and bounties, and Allah has boundless  knowledge.[268]
He grants wisdom to whom He pleases; and whoever is granted  wisdom is indeed given a great wealth, yet none except people of understanding  learn a lesson from it.[269]
Whatever you spend in charity or whatever vow you make, surely Allah knows it. The  wrongdoers shall have no helpers.[270]
To give charity in public is good, but to give  to the poor in private is better and will remove from you some of your sins. Allah is  aware of your actions.[271]
O Prophet, you are not responsible for their guidance, it  is Allah Who guides whom He pleases. Whatever wealth you spend in charity, it is to  your own advantage; provided you give to seek the pleasure of Allah. Whatever  wealth you spend for the sake of Allah, will be paid back to you in full, and you will  not be wronged.[272]
Charity is for those needy people who are engaged so much in  the cause of Allah that they cannot move about in the land to earn their livelihood: the  ignorant think that they are wealthy on account of their modest behavior. You can  recognize them by their look because they do not make insistent demands on  people. Whatever you spend on them, surely Allah knows it.[273]
Those who spend their wealth in charity by night and day, secretly and openly, they  will have their reward from their Lord. They shall have nothing to fear or to  regret.[274]
Those who live on usury will not rise up before Allah except like those who are driven  to madness by the touch of Satan. That is because they claim: "Trading is no  different than usury, but Allah has made trading lawful and usury unlawful. He who  has received the admonition from his Lord and has mended his way may keep his  previous gains; Allah will be his judge. Those who turn back (repeat this crime), they  shall be the inmates of hellfire wherein they will live forever.[275]
Allah has laid His  curse on usury and blessed charity to prosper. Allah does not love any ungrateful  sinner.[276]
Those who believe and do good deeds, establish regular prayers, and give regular  charity will have their reward with their Lord. They will have nothing to fear or to  regret.[277]
O You who believe! Fear Allah and waive what is still due to you from  usury if you are indeed believers; [278]
or war shall be declared against you by Allah  and His Messenger. If you repent, you may retain your principal, causing no loss to  debtor and suffering no loss.[279]
If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time till it is  easy for him to repay; but if you waive the sum by way of charity it will be better for  you, if you understand it.[280]
Fear the Day when you shall all return to Allah; when  every one shall be paid in full what they have earned and none shall be dealt with  unjustly.[281]
O believers! When you deal with each other in lending for a fixed period of time, put it  in writing. Let a scribe write it down with justice between the parties. The scribe, who  is given the gift of literacy by Allah, should not refuse to write; he is under obligation  to write. Let him who incurs the liability (debtor) dictate, fearing Allah his Lord and not  diminishing anything from the settlement. If the borrower is mentally unsound or  weak or is unable to dictate himself, let the guardian of his interests dictate for him  with justice. Let two witnesses from among you bear witness to all such documents, if  two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice should bear  witness, so that if one of the women forgets anything the other may remind her. The  witnesses must not refuse when they are called upon to do so. You must not be  averse to writing (your contract) for a future period, whether it is a small matter or big.  This action is more just for you in the sight of Allah, because it facilitates the  establishment of evidence and is the best way to remove all doubts; but if it is a  common commercial transaction concluded on the spot among yourselves, there is  no blame on you if you do not put it in writing. You should have witnesses when you  make commercial transactions. Let no harm be done to the scribe or witnesses; and  if you do so, you shall be guilty of transgression. Fear Allah; it is Allah that teaches  you and Allah has knowledge of everything.[282]
If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe to write down the transaction, then  transact your business by taking possession of a pledge. If one of you entrust  another with a pledge, let the trustee deliver the pledged property to its owner, and  let him fear Allah, his Lord. Do not conceal testimony, and whoever conceals it, his  heart is surely sinful. Allah is aware of all your actions.[283]
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. Whether you reveal what  is in your minds or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He, however, has full  authority to pardon or punish anyone He pleases. Allah has complete power over  everything.[284]
The Messenger believes in the Guidance revealed to him from his Lord and so do the  Believers. They all believe in Allah, His angels, His books and His Messengers. They  say: "We do not discriminate against anyone of His Messengers." And they say: "We  hear and we obey. Grant us Your forgiveness, O Lord; to You we shall all  return."[285]
Allah does not burden any human being with more than he can bear.  Everyone will enjoy the credit of his deeds and suffer the debits of his evil-doings.  The believers say: "Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our  Lord! Do not place on us a burden as You placed on those before us. Our Lord! Lay  not on us the kind of burden that we have no strength to bear. Pardon us, Forgive us,  Have mercy on us. You are our Protector, help us against the unbelievers."[286]
