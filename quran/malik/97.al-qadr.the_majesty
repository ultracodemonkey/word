Surely We have revealed this (Qur’an) in the night of Qadr.[1]
And what will make  you understand, what the night of Qadr is![2]
The night of Qadr is better than one  thousand months.[3]
The angels and the Spirit (Gabriel) come down with every  decree, by the leave of their Lord,[4]
that night is the night of Peace, till the break of  dawn.[5]
