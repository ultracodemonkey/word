Has the news of the over shadowing event of resurrection reached you?[1]
On that  Day some faces shall be downcast,[2]
in hard labor, worn out,[3]
scorching in the  blazing fire,[4]
given to drink from a boiling fountain.[5]
They shall have no food  except bitter thorny fruit,[6]
which will neither provide nourishment nor satisfy  hunger.[7]
While some faces on that Day shall be radiant,[8]
well pleased with their  endeavors,[9]
in a lofty garden.[10]
Therein they shall hear no loose talk.[11]
Therein  they shall have running springs.[12]
Therein they shall be reclining on raised soft  couches,[13]
with goblets placed before them;[14]
silky cushions ranged in order[15]
and fine carpets richly spread.[16]
Do they not look at the camels, how they were created?[17]
The heaven, how it was  raised high?[18]
The mountains, how they were firmly set?[19]
And the earth, how it  is spread out?[20]
So keep on giving admonition, for you are an admonisher[21]
not  a taskmaster over them.[22]
As for those who turn their backs and disbelieve,[23]
Allah will punish them with the mighty punishment.[24]
Surely to Us is their  return,[25]
then surely it is for Us to take their account.[26]
