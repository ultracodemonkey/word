O mankind! Have fear of your Lord; the catastrophic quaking of the Hour of Doom will  be terrible indeed.[1]
On that Day you shall see that every nursing mother will forget  her nursing-babe and every pregnant female will miscarry, and you will see people as  if they are intoxicated, though they will not be drunk: such will be the horror of Allah’s  chastisement.[2]
Yet there are some among people, who in their ignorance, argue  about Allah and follow every rebellious devil,[3]
though they are doomed to seduce  whoever takes them as their friends and lead him to the punishment of burning  fire.[4]
O mankind! If you doubt that there is life after death remember that We first created  you from dust, then from a sperm, then from a leech- like mass, then from a morsel  of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may manifest to you Our  power. We cause to remain in the womb whom We wish for an appointed term, and  then We bring you forth as infants; then We nourish you so that you may reach your  age of full strength. There are some of you who die young and some who live on to  their abject old age when all that they once knew they know no more. You sometimes  see the land dry and barren; but no sooner do We pour down rain upon it then it  begins to stir and swell, putting forth every kind of beautiful growth in pairs.[5]
This is  because Allah is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead and it is He Who has  power over everything,[6]
and this is a proof that the Hour of Doom is sure to come there  is no doubt about it; and that Allah will raise up those who are in the graves.[7]
Yet there are others among people who wrangle about Allah, though they neither  have knowledge nor guidance, nor an enlightening Book,[8]
twisting things around in  order to lead others astray from the Path of Allah - for such persons there is disgrace  in this life, and on the Day of Judgment we shall make them taste the punishment of  burning fire,[9]
saying: "This is what you prepared and sent forth with your own  hands." Rest assured that Allah is not unjust to His worshippers.[10]
There are some people who worship Allah standing on the verge of faith (half faith  and half disbelief). When such a person is blessed with good fortune he is content;  but if he encounters a trial he turns back headlong; thus losing both this world and  the Hereafter, which is a clear-cut loss.[11]
Then instead of Allah, he starts calling  those deities who can neither harm nor help him; now that is going too far off in  deviation from the Right Way.[12]
He is calling upon those who are more likely to  harm than help; what an evil master and what an evil friend he chooses for help![13]
As for those who believe and do good deeds, Allah will admit them to gardens  beneath which the rivers flow. Surely Allah does what He wants.[14]
If anyone thinks that Allah will not help His Messenger in this world and in the  Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the sky if he can and cut a hole to peep  through and see for himself whether his device can avert that which irritates him.[15]
Thus have We revealed this The Qur’an in clear verses; and verily Allah gives  guidance to whom He wants.[16]
Surely as for those who are true believers (the  Muslims), the Jews, the Sabians, the Christians, the Magians and the ones who  commit shirk (polytheists) - Allah will judge between them on the Day of  Resurrection; for Allah is a witness over everything.[17]
Do you not see how all who  dwell in the heavens and the earth bow down in worship to Allah, including the sun,  the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the animals, and a large number of  people, even a large number of those deserving the punishment. He who is humbled  by Allah has none who can raise him to honor; surely Allah does what He  pleases.[18]
These are the two adversaries (the believers and disbelievers) who dispute with each  other about their Lord: as for the disbelievers, garments of Fire will be cut out for  them, boiling water will be poured over their heads,[19]
which will not only melt their  skins but also the inner parts of their bellies,[20]
and there will be maces of iron to  lash them.[21]
Whenever, in their anguish, they try to escape therefrom, they will be  forced back therein, and will be told: "Taste the punishment of conflagration!"[22]
As for those who have faith and do good deeds, Allah will certainly admit them to  gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall be decked with pearls and bracelets of  gold, and their garments will be of silk.[23]
This is because during their life on earth,  they were guided to accept the pure words of Allah and they were shown the Way of  the All-Praiseworthy.[24]
As for those who are unbelievers and debar others from the  Way of Allah and from the Masjid-al-Haram, to which We have assigned all mankind  with equal rights whether they are natives or foreigners, and whoever intends to  deviate from righteousness to wrongdoing in its vicinity, We will make him taste a  painful punishment.[25]
Remember! We identified the site of the Sacred House to Abraham, saying, "Worship  none besides Me, sanctify My House for those worshippers who make Tawaf  (walking counterclockwise around it as a part of the Hajj rituals), and stand in prayer,  bow, and prostrate themselves,[26]
and make a proclamation of Hajj (Pilgrimage) to  mankind: they will come to you on foot and on lean camels from every distant  quarter,[27]
so that they may witness the benefits which are made available here for  them, and pronounce the name of Allah over the cattle which We have provided as  food for them, on the appointed days, then eat meat themselves and feed the  indigent and needy.[28]
Then they should accomplish their needful acts of shaving or  cutting their hair and taking a bath, fulfill their vows and go for Tawaf-e-Ziyarah to the  Ancient House.[29]
This was the object for which the Ka’bah was built, and whoever  honors the sacred rites of Allah, it is good for him in the sight of his Lord. The meat of  cattle is lawful to you, except what has already been mentioned to you; therefore,  shun the abomination of idols and shun all false statements.[30]
Dedicate yourselves to Allah and do not commit shirk with Him: for anyone who  commits shirk, it is as though he had fallen from the sky; then his body is either  snatched away by birds or carried away by the wind to some far-off place,[31]
so it is,  and he who respects the Symbols of Allah, surely shows the piety of his heart.[32]
You may benefit (by using their milk) from the cattle dedicated for sacrifice, until the  time of their slaughter, then their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House.[33]
For every nation We prescribed a way of sacrifice so that they may pronounce the  name of Allah over the cattle which He has given them for food, your God is one  God; so submit yourselves to Him as a Muslim, and give good news to the  humble,[34]
whose hearts tremble at the mention of Allah; who endure adversity with  patience, who establish Salah and spend in charity out of what we have given  them.[35]
We have included the sacrificial camels among the Symbols of Allah, for  there is much good for you in them. Therefore, pronounce the name of Allah over  them while standing, and when they fall down on their sides after slaughter, then eat  of their meat, feed the contented (poor who do not ask) and the beggars (poor who  ask). Thus We have subjected these animals to you so that you may be grateful.[36]
It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah; it is your piety that reaches  Him. Thus, He has subjected these animals to you so that you may glorify Allah for  giving you guidance, and O Prophet, give good news to those who do good to  others.[37]
Surely Allah wards off evil from those who are true believers: for certainly  Allah does not love anyone who is treacherous, ungrateful.[38]
Permission to fight back is hereby granted to the believers against whom war is  waged and because they are oppressed; certainly Allah has power to grant them  victory[39]
- those who have been unjustly expelled from their homes only because  they said, "Our Lord is Allah." Had not Allah repelled some people by the might of  others, the monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s praise  is daily celebra
These are the  people who, if We establish them in the land, will establish Salah and pay Zakah,  enjoin justice and forbid evil; the final decision of all affairs is in the hands of  Allah.[41]
If they deny you O Muhammad, remember that before them the people of Noah, ‘Ad  and Thamud;[42]
the people of Abraham and Lot;[43]
as well as the residents of  Madyan had denied their Prophets, likewise Moses was also denied. Initially, I gave  respite to all those unbelievers and then I seized them: see how terrible was My  disapproval![44]
How many townships, teaming with wrong doings, have We utterly  destroyed! Today they lie with their roofs fallen in, their wells abandoned, and their  lofty castles deserted.[45]
Have they not traveled through the land? Have they no hearts to learn wisdom, or  ears to hear the Truth? Certainly it is not their eyes which are blind, but it is the  hearts in their breasts which are blind.[46]
These people ask you to hasten the  threatened punishment. Well, Allah will never go back on His promise. In fact a day  of your Lord (time period in which Allah's decision is executed) is equal to a thousand  years of your calculation.[47]
There have been many townships teeming with wrong  doings, to whom at first I gave respite and at the end I smote them. Towards Me is  the destination of all.[48]
O Muhammad, tell them: "O mankind! I am merely a plain Warner to you;[49]
Those  who accept the true faith and do good deeds shall be forgiven and provided  honorable sustenance;[50]
but those who strive against Our revelations, shall be the  inmates of flaming fire."[51]
Never have We sent a Messenger or a prophet before you, O Muhammad, with  whose wishes Satan did not tamper; but Allah abrogates the interjections of Satan  and confirms His own revelations, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.[52]
He makes  Satan’s interjections a temptation for those whose hearts suffer from the disease of  hypocrisy and whose hearts are hardened - that’s why the wrongdoers are in such an  extreme dissension[53]
- so that those who are endowed with knowledge may realize  that this (Qur’an) is the Truth from your Lord and thus believe in it and humble their  hearts towards Him, and surely Allah will guide the believers to the Straight Way.[54]
As for the unbelievers, they will never cease to doubt the revelation, until the Hour of  Doom overtakes them suddenly or there comes on them the punishment of the Day  of Disaster.[55]
On that Day the Kingdom will be that of Allah’s; He will judge  between them; so those who have embraced the true faith and done good deeds  shall enter the gardens of delight;[56]
but the unbelievers who have denied Our  revelations shall receive a disgraceful punishment.[57]
As for those who migrated for the sake of Allah and afterwards were killed or died,  Allah will make a generous provision for them; certainly Allah is the One Who is the  best Provider.[58]
He will admit them to a place with which they shall be well  pleased; for Allah is All-Knowing, Most Lenient.[59]
Thus shall it be! He that retaliates  equal to the infliction he received and then is wronged again, will most certainly be  helped by Allah; surely Allah is the One Who is All-Forbearing, Most Forgiving.[60]
That is because it is Allah Who causes the night to pass into the day, and the day  into the night, Allah is indeed All-Hearing, Most Observing.[61]
That is because Allah  is the One Who is Real; and all those deities besides Him, whom they invoke, are  false; indeed it is Allah Who is the Supreme, the Great.[62]
Do you not see that Allah  sends down water from the sky so the land becomes green? Surely Allah is the  Benignant, Aware.[63]
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; surely  Allah is the One Who is the Self-sufficient, the Praiseworthy.[64]
Do you not see that Allah has subdued to you all that is in the earth and the ships  that sail through the sea by His command? He is withholding the sky in a way that it  cannot fall down on the earth without His permission; surely Allah is very kind and  merciful to mankind.[65]
He is the One Who has given you life, will cause you to die  and then will bring you back to life again - yet man is indeed very ungrateful.[66]
To  every nation We have prescribed the rites of worship which they observe, therefore,  let them not dispute with you concerning this matter - keep calling them to the Way of  your Lord; for most surely you are rightly guided.[67]
If they argue with you, say: "Allah knows best all that you do."[68]
Allah will judge  between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matters in which you  differ.[69]
Do you not know that Allah is aware of all that is in heaven and the earth?  Certainly all of this is recorded in a Book and it is very easy for Allah to do so.[70]
Yet  they worship besides Allah those deities for which He has revealed no sanction, nor  they themselves have any knowledge about them; certainly the wrongdoers shall  have no helper.[71]
When Our revelations are recited to them with all their clarity,  you can notice a denial on the faces of the unbelievers. They can barely restrain  themselves from assaulting those who recite Our revelations. Say to them: "Shall I  tell you something which is far worse than that? It is the fire of hell, which Allah has  promised to those who reject the truth; what an evil abode it will be!"[72]
O mankind! Here is an example for your understanding, so listen to it carefully. Those  deities whom you call besides Allah, cannot create a single fly, even if they all  combined their forces, rather, if a fly snatches away anything from them they cannot  even get it back; how feebleminded are the suppliants and how powerless are those  whom they supplicate![73]
They do not render to Allah the homage due to Him; in  fact, Allah is the One Who is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.[74]
Allah chooses His messengers from among the angels and from among the human  beings, for surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.[75]
He knows what is before them  and what is behind them, and to Allah shall all matters return for decision.[76]
O  believers! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord and do good deeds so  that you may attain salvation.[77]
Strive in the Way of Allah as you ought to strive  with sincerity and discipline; He has chosen you and has not laid upon you any  hardship in the observance of your faith - the faith of your father Abraham. He named  you Muslims before in prior scriptures and in this (The Qur’an), so that His  Messenger may testify against you and you yourselves may testify against rest of the  mankind. Therefore, establish Salah, pay Zakah and hold fast to Allah, Who is your  Protector - so what an excellent Protector and what a splendid Supporter![78]
