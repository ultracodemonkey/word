Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the Army of the Elephant  (reference is made to Abraha, a Christian king of Yaman, who attacked Mecca with  the army of elephants in the year of the Prophet Muhammad’s birth)?[1]
Did He not  make their treacherous plan a flop?[2]
And send against them flocks of birds,[3]
which pelted them with stones of baked clay,[4]
thus rendered them like the chewed- up chaff.[5]
