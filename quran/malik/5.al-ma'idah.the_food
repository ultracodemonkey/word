O believers! Fulfil your contract obligations.  All four-legged animals from livestock are lawful to you other than those which are  hereby announced. However do not violate the prohibition of hunting while you are in  Ihram (Hajj dress). Indeed Allah orders whatever He pleases.[1]
O believers! Do not  violate the sanctity of the Symbols of Allah: the Sacred Month , the animals brought  for sacrifice, the garlands that mark such animals, and those people visiting the  Sacred House (Ka'bah) to seek the grace and good pleasure of their Lord. When you  put off your Ihram (pilgrimage is over) then you are allowed to hunt. Let not the  hatred of some people - who once hindered you from the Sacred Mosque - incite you  to commit transgression. Cooperate with one another in righteousness and piety, and  do not cooperate in sin and transgression. Have fear of Allah. Allah is stern in  punishment.[2]
You are forbidden to eat the meat of any animal that dies by itself (dead body), blood,  the flesh of swine (pork) and that on which any name other than Allah's has been  invoked; also that which is strangled to death , killed by a violent blow, killed by a  headlong fall and of those beaten or gored to death; and that which has been partly  eaten by a wild animal unless you are able to slaughter it before its death; also that  which is sacrificed on altars or is divided by raffling of arrows. All these are sinful  acts. Today the unbelievers have given up all their hope of vanquishing your religion.  Have no fear of them, fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you,  completed my favor upon you and approved Al-Islam as a Deen (way of life for you).  Anyone who is compelled by hunger to eat what is forbidden, not intending to commit  sin, will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful.[3]
They ask you what food is lawful for them, say: All good clean things are lawful for  you, as well as what you have taught your hunting birds and beasts to catch, trained  by you with the knowledge given to you by Allah. Eat what they catch and hold for  you, however, pronounce the name of Allah over it. Have fear of Allah. Allah is swift  in settling the accounts.[4]
Today all good clean things have been made lawful for  you; and the food of the People of the Book is also made lawful for you and your food  is made lawful for them. Likewise, marriage with chaste free believing women and  also chaste women among the People who were given the Book before you is made  lawful for you, provided that you give them their dowries and desire chastity, neither  committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses. Anyone who commits Kufr with  Iman (rejects the rules provided by faith), all his good deeds will be in vain and in the  Hereafter he will be one of the losers.[5]
O believers! When you rise up for Salah (prayer), wash your faces and your hands as  far as the elbows, wipe your heads with wet hands and wash your feet to the ankles.  If you had an emission of semen, then take a full bath. However, if you are sick or on  a journey or you have used the toilet or you had intercourse with your women (your  wives) and you do not find any water then resort to Tayammum - find clean soil and  rub your faces and hands with it. Allah does not wish to burden you; He only wishes  to purify you and to perfect His favor upon you, so that you may be thankful.[6]
Remember Allah’s favor to you and the covenant which He ratified with you when  you said: "We hear and we obey." Have fear of Allah; surely Allah knows the secrets  of your hearts.[7]
O believers! Be steadfast for the sake of Allah and bear true  witness and let not the enmity of a people incite you to do injustice; do justice; that is  nearer to piety. Fear Allah, surely Allah is fully aware of all your actions.[8]
Allah has  promised those who believe and do good deeds that for them there is forgiveness  and mighty reward.[9]
As for those who reject faith and deny Our revelations, they  will be the companions of hellfire.[10]
O believers! Also remember Allah’s favor which  He recently bestowed upon you when He restrained the hands of those who sought  to harm you (Jewish plan to kill the Prophet and eminent companions through an  invitation to a dinner which Allah informed him not to attend). Have fear of Allah; and  in Allah let the believers put their trust.[11]
Allah did in fact make a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve  chieftains from among them and said: "I am with you; if you establish Salah (prayers)  pay Zakah, believe in My Messengers, support them and give a generous loan to  Allah (spend in charity), I will certainly forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens  beneath which rivers flow. However, if any one of you, after this, violates this  covenant, he will indeed go astray from the Right Way."[12]
Even after that, they  broke their covenant; as a result, We laid on them Our curse and hardened their  hearts. They tampered with words out of their context and neglected much of what  they were enjoined. You will always find most of them deceitful except for a few of  them. Yet forgive them and overlook their misdeeds. Allah loves those who are kind  to others.[13]
Likewise, We also made a covenant with those who call themselves Christians, but  they too have neglected much of what they were enjoined. As a result, We stirred  among them enmity and hatred, which will last till the Day of Resurrection and soon  Allah will inform them all of what they have done.[14]
O people of the Book (Jews  and Christians)! Now Our Messenger has come to you to reveal much of what you  have concealed from the Holy Books and to pass over much which is no longer  necessary. There has come to you from Allah a new Light and a clear Book,[15]
with  which Allah will guide to the ways of peace all those who seek His good pleasure and  bring them out of the depth of darkness into the light of His grace and guide them to  the Right Way.[16]
Indeed those have committed Kufr (rejected faith) who said, "God is the Messiah, son  of Mary." O Muhammad, ask them, "Who has the power to prevent Allah if He chose  to destroy the Messiah, the son of Mary, his mother and all that is in the earth? Allah  has the sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He  creates what He pleases and has power over everything."[17]
The Jews and the Christians say: "We are the children of Allah and His beloved  ones." Ask them, "Why then does He punish you for your sins? Nay! In fact you are  human beings like others which He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and  He punishes whom He pleases. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and  the earth and all that is between them, and to Him is the final refuge."[18]
O people  of the Book! Indeed Our Messenger has now come to you making clear to you the  teaching of the Right Way, after a long break in the series of the Messengers, so that  you may not be able to say, "No one has come to give us good news or to warn us."  Now someone has come to give you good news and warn you so listen to him. Allah  has power over everything.[19]
Ponder upon the incident when Moses said to his people: "O my people! Remember  the favors which Allah has bestowed upon you. He has raised Prophets from among  you, made you kings and gave you that which had not been given to anyone in the  worlds."[20]
O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah has assigned for you. Do  not turn back, because if you do, you will become losers.[21]
They said: "O Moses!  A nation of giants live in there, we will not set our foot in it until they leave. As soon  as they leave we will be ready to enter."[22]
Thereupon two Allah-fearing men upon  whom Allah had bestowed His Grace said: "Attack directly at the city gate, once you  enter it, you will surely be victorious. Put your trust in Allah if you are really  believers."[23]
They replied, "O Moses! We will never enter it so long as they remain  therein. Therefore, both you and your Lord should go and fight, we will stay  here."[24]
Hearing this Moses prayed, "O my Lord! I have no control over anyone  except myself and my brother. Please, set us apart from these disobedient  people."[25]
Allah responded, "Very well, they are forbidden this land for forty years,  during this time they will wander homeless on the earth, so do not grieve for these  disobedient people."[26]
Recite to them in all truth the story of Adam's two sons: How each offered a sacrifice,  and how the offering of one was accepted while that of the other was not. The latter  said: "I will kill you." The former replied: "Allah only accepts the sacrifice from the  righteous.[27]
Even if you stretch your hand to kill me, I shall not stretch my hand to  slay you, for I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.[28]
I intend to let you bear the  burden of my sins as well as yours and thus become an inmate of the Fire which is  the reward for wrongdoers."[29]
The latter's soul prompted him to kill his brother; he  killed him and thus became one of the losers.[30]
(He carried around the dead body  of his brother and did not know what to do with it.) Then Allah sent a raven, which  dug the ground to show him how to bury the dead body of his brother. "Alas!" He  cried, "I failed even to be like this raven to find some way to dispose of the dead body  of my brother!" So he became full of regrets.[31]
On account of that incident, We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever kills  a person, except as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land, it will be written  in his book of deeds as if he had killed all the human beings on the surface of the  Earth and whoever will save a life shall be regarded as if he gave life to all the human  beings on the surface of the Earth. Yet, even though Our Messengers came to them  one after the other with clear revelations, it was not long before, many of them  committed excesses in the land.[32]
The punishment for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive  to create mischief in the land is death or crucifixion or the cutting off their hands and  feet from opposite sides or exile from the land based on the gravity of their offense.  This will be their humiliation in this world and in the Hereafter they will have grievous  punishment,[33]
except those who repent before you apprehend them, in such a  case, you should know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[34]
O believers! Fear Allah and seek the means to be closer to Him and make Jihad  (struggle) in His Way so that you may be successful.[35]
As for those who are  unbelievers, if they have everything that the earth contains or twice as much to offer  as a ransom to redeem themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection,  it will not be accepted from them and they shall have a painful punishment.[36]
They  will desire to get out of the fire but will not be able to do so and they shall have an  everlasting punishment.[37]
Male or female, whoever is guilty of theft, cut off the hand (that was used in theft) of  either of them as a punishment for their crime. This is exemplary punishment  ordained by Allah. Allah is Mighty, Wise.[38]
But whoever repents after committing  the crime and reforms his conduct, Allah will surely turn to him with forgiveness. Allah  is Forgiving, Merciful.[39]
Don’t you know that Allah has sovereignty over the  heavens and the earth? He may punish whom He pleases and forgive whom He  pleases. Allah has power over everything.[40]
O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who plunge headlong into unbelief; those who  say with their tongues: We believe, but have no faith in their hearts; and do not grieve  for those Jews, who listen to lies and spy for other people who had never come to  you. They tamper with the words of Allah and take them out of their context and say:  "If you are given such and such commandment, accept it; but if it is other than this,  reject it." If Allah intends to put anyone to trial, you have no authority in the least to  save him from Allah. Such people are those whose hearts Allah does not desire to  purify; they will have humiliation in this world and a grievous punishment in the  Hereafter.[41]
That is because they listen to falsehood and eat what is forbidden.  Therefore, if they come to you with their cases, you may judge between them or  refuse to do so. Even if you refuse, they will not be able to harm you the least, but if  you do act as a judge, judge between them with fairness, for Allah loves those who  judge with fairness.[42]
But why do they come to you for Judgment when they have  the Torah which contains Allah’s commandments? Yet they turn back after that. In  fact, they are not true believers.[43]
Indeed We revealed the Torah to Moses, in which there is guidance and light: By its  laws, all the Prophets, who were Muslims, judged those who call themselves Jews  and so did the Rabbis and jurists of law. They were entrusted the protection of Allah’s  Book and they themselves were witnesses. Have no fear of people; fear Me, and do  not sell My revelations for a petty price: those who do not judge by the law which  Allah has revealed, are indeed kafirs (unbelievers).[44]
We ordained in Torah for  them: "A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth  for a tooth and for a wound an equal retaliation." But if anyone remits the retaliation  by way of charity it will be an act of atonement for him; those who do not judge by the  law which Allah has revealed, they are the wrongdoers.[45]
Then in the footsteps of those Prophets, We sent Jesus the son of Mary confirming  whatever remained intact from the Torah in his time, and gave him the Gospel  wherein was guidance and light, corroborating what was revealed in the Torah; a  guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.[46]
Therefore, let the people  who follow the Gospel judge by the Law which Allah has revealed therein; those who  do not judge by the Law which Allah has revealed, they are the transgressors.[47]
To you, O Muhammad, We have revealed this Book with the truth. It confirms  whatever has remained intact in the scriptures which came before it and also to  safeguard it. Therefore, judge between people according to Allah’s revelations and  do not yield to their vain desires, diverging from the truth which has come to you. We  have ordained a law and a Way of life for each of you. If Allah wanted He could have  made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what  He has given you; therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all  shall return to Allah; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you  dispute.[48]
So, O Muhammad, pronounce Judgment among them according to the  law which Allah has revealed and do not follow their vain desires, and beware of  them lest they tempt you away from a part of that which Allah has revealed to you. If  they reject your Judgment, then know that it is Allah’s wish to scourge them for some  of their sins. In fact most of the people are transgressors.[49]
By rejecting the Divine  Law do they wish to be judged by the laws of ignorance? Who is a better Judge than  Allah for those who believe in Him?[50]
O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as your protecting friends: they are  only protecting friends of one another. Whoever of you disobeys this commandment  will be counted as one of them. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.[51]
You  see that those who have the disease of hypocrisy in their hearts move around in their  camp saying: "We fear lest a turn of fortune strike us." But soon when Allah gives you  victory or a decision according to His will, they will regret for what they are hiding in  their hearts.[52]
At that time the believers will say: "Are these the same people who  solemnly swore by Allah that they would stand beside you?" As a result all their  deeds will be voided and they will become losers.[53]
O believers! Whoever among you renounce Islam, let them do so; soon Allah will  replace them with others whom He will love and they will love Him, who will be  humble towards the believers, mighty against the unbelievers, striving hard in the  way of Allah, and will have no fear of reproach from any critic. Now this is the grace  of Allah which He bestows on whom He pleases. Allah has boundless  knowledge.[54]
Your real protecting friends are Allah, His Messenger, and the fellow  believers - the ones who establish Salah, pay Zakah and bow down humbly before  Allah.[55]
Whoever makes Allah, His Messenger and the fellow believers his  protecting friends, must know that Allah’s party will surely be victorious.[56]
O believers! Do not make your protecting friends those, from among the people who  were given the Book before you and the unbelievers, who have made your religion a  mockery or pastime, fear Allah if you are true believers.[57]
When you call for Salah  (prayers) they make it as an object of mockery and pastime; this is because they are  a people devoid of understanding.[58]
Tell them: "O people of the Book! What makes  you against us other than that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to  us and what was revealed before? The fact is that most of you are rebellious  transgressors."[59]
Ask them: "Should I tell you of those who will have even worse  than this in retribution from Allah? They are those whom Allah has cursed; who have  incurred His wrath; some of whom were turned into apes and pigs; who worshipped  Taghut (forces of Satan); these are worse in rank and far more astray from the Right  Way."[60]
When they come to you they say: "We believe". But in fact, unbelievers they came  and unbelievers they depart. Allah knows fully well what they hide in their hearts.[61]
You will see many of them try to beat each other in sin and rancor, and they  consume what is unlawful. Evil indeed is what they do.[62]
Why don’t their Rabbis  and the Jurists of laws forbid them from uttering sinful words and eating unlawful  things? Evil indeed are their deeds.[63]
The Jews say: Allah’s hand is tied up! - Nay!  Their own hands will be tied up and they will be cursed for what they utter. Both of  His hands are free; However, He spends as He pleases. The fact is that the  revelations that have come to you from Allah will surely make many of them increase  in their wickedness and unbelief. We have stirred among them enmity and hatred till  the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it.  Now they are striving to spread mischief in the land. Allah does not love those who  do mischief.[64]
If instead of this rebellious attitude the people of the Book had  believed and become Godfearing, We would certainly have removed their iniquities  and admitted them to the gardens of Bliss (Paradise).[65]
If they would have  observed the Laws of Torah and the Gospel and other Revelations which were sent  to them from their Lord, they would have certainly enjoyed abundance from above  and from beneath. Though there are some among them on the moderate course; yet  most of them do nothing but evil.[66]
O Messenger! Deliver the message which has been revealed to you from your Lord,  and if you do not, you are not doing justice to your mission. Allah will protect you from  the mischief of the people. Rest assured that Allah will not let the unbelievers  succeed against you.[67]
Tell them: O people of the Book! You have no ground to  stand on unless you observe the Torah, Gospel and other revelations that have come  to you from your Lord. This revelation (The Qur'an) which has come to you from your  Lord will surely increase the rebellion and disbelief of many of them but you should  not grieve for the disbelievers.[68]
Rest assured that the believers (Muslims), the  Jews, the Sabians and the Christians - whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day  and does righteous deeds - will have nothing to fear or to regret.[69]
Certainly We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them Messengers.  Whenever there came to them a Messenger with a message that did not suit their  fancies, either they called him an impostor or they put him to death.[70]
They thought  no affliction would follow; so they acted blind and deaf. Yet Allah, in extreme mercy,  accepted their repentance, but again many acted blind and deaf towards the  message of Allah. Allah is observant of their actions.[71]
Certainly they have disbelieved who say: "Allah is Christ the son of Mary." While  Christ himself said: "O children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord."  Whoever commits shirk (joins partners with Allah), Allah will deny him the paradise,  and the hellfire will be his home. There will be no helper for the wrongdoers.[72]
Certainly they are unbelievers who say: "Allah is one of three in a Trinity." There is no  god except One Allah. If they do not stop saying what they say, a painful punishment  will befall the disbelievers among them.[73]
Will they not then turn to Allah and seek  His forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[74]
Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; many Messengers had  already passed away before him. His mother was a truthful woman; they both ate  earthly food like other human beings. See how the Revelations are made clear to  them to know the reality; yet see how they ignore the truth![75]
Ask them: "Would you  worship besides Allah someone who can neither harm nor benefit you? While Allah is  He who hears all and knows all."[76]
Tell them: "O people of the Book! Do not  transgress the bounds of truth in your religion, and do not yield to the fancies of those  people who went astray before you, They misled many others and have themselves  strayed away from The Right Way.[77]
Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue  of Davidand Jesus the son of Mary: because they disobeyed and committed  excesses.[78]
They would not forbid one another from committing iniquities; evil  indeed were their deeds.[79]
As you can see many of them are taking the side of the  unbelievers. Evil is that, which their souls have sent forth for them for the Hereafter.  Because they have incurred the wrath of Allah, so in punishment, they are going to  live forever.[80]
Had they believed in Allah, in the Prophet, and in what was revealed  to him, they would have never taken unbelievers as their protecting friends instead of  believers, but most of them are rebellious transgressors.[81]
You will find the most  violent in enmity to the believers are the Jews and the pagans (pagan Arabs); and  nearest in affection to the believers are those who say: "We are Christians." That is  because among them there are men that are priests and monks, who do not behave  arrogantly.[82]
When they (monks and priests) listen to that which is revealed to the Messenger, you  can see their eyes filled with tears, because they recognize the truth. They say: "Our  Lord! We believe, therefore, write us down among the witnesses of truth.[83]
Why  should not we believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us? Why should we  not hope that our Lord will admit us to the company of the righteous?"[84]
And for  their prayer Allah has rewarded them with gardens beneath which rivers flow to live  therein forever. Such is the recompense of the righteous (who do good to  others).[85]
As for those who reject and deny Our revelations, they shall become the  inmates of hellfire.[86]
O believers! Do not make unlawful those wholesome things which Allah has made  lawful for you. Do not transgress; Allah does not love the transgressors.[87]
Eat of  the lawful and wholesome things which Allah has provided for you. Fear Allah, in  Whom you believe.[88]
Allah will not call you to account for what is inadvertent in  your oaths. But He will hold you accountable for that which you solemnly swear. The  penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten indigent persons with such food as you  normally provide to your own family, or to clothe ten needy people, or to free one  slave. The one who cannot afford any of these must fast three days. This is the  expiation for breaking your oaths. Therefore, be mindful of your oaths. Thus Allah  makes clear to you His revelations that you may be thankful.[89]
O believers! Intoxicants and gambling (games of chance), dedication to stones  (paying tribute to idols) and division by arrows (lottery) are the filthy works of Satan.  Get away from them, so that you may prosper.[90]
Satan desires to stir up enmity  and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from the  remembrance of Allah and from Salah (prayers). Will you not abstain?[91]
Obey  Allah and obey the Messenger and abstain from these things. If you do not, then you  should know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to pass on My message clearly.[92]
There is no blame on those who believe and do good deeds for what they ate in the  past, provided they abstain from those things which have been made unlawful, then  remain steadfast in their belief and do righteous deeds, then abstain themselves from  whatever they are forbidden and believe in Divine Law, and then fear Allah and do  good deeds. For Allah loves those who do good deeds.[93]
O believers! Allah will put you to trial by making game (that which is to be hunted)  well within the reach of your hands and your spears in order to see who fears Him,  though unseen. There shall, therefore, be a painful punishment for those who  transgress after this warning.[94]
O believers! Do not kill game while you are in Ihram  (pilgrim garb). If anyone kills game intentionally, he will have to pay a penalty through  an offering brought to the Ka’bah of a domestic animal equivalent to the one which  was killed as determined by two just men among you; or as an expiation, either feed  a few indigent or fast their equivalent days, so that he may taste the evil  consequences of what he did. Allah has forgiven what happened in the past; but if  anyone repeats it now, Allah will inflict retribution on him. Allah is Mighty, Capable of  Retribution.[95]
Game of the sea and its use as food is lawful for you and the  seafarers, but the game of the land is forbidden as long as you are in Ihram (pilgrim  garb). Have fear of Allah to whom you shall all be assembled.[96]
Allah has made the Ka‘bah of the Sacred House an eternal value for mankind, and  so are the Sacred Months, the animal offerings, and the animals which are collared  as a mark of dedication; so you must know that Allah has knowledge of what is in the  heavens and in the earth and that Allah is well aware of everything.[97]
You should  also know that Allah is stern in Retribution, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[98]
The only duty of the Messenger is to pass on My Message. Allah knows all what you  reveal and what you conceal.[99]
Tell them, "Bad and good are not equal, even  though the abundance of the bad may dazzle you; so fear Allah, O people of  understanding, that you may prosper!" [100]
O believers! Do not ask questions about things that if revealed to you, may cause  you trouble. But if you ask a question about something when the Qur’an is being  revealed, it will be made known to you. Allah has forgiven you what you did to date,  Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.[101]
Some people before you did ask such questions  and later lost their faith because of those very things.[102]
Allah did not institute  superstitions like those of a slit-ear she-camel or a she-camel let loose for free  pasture or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals or stallion-camels freed from work;  this lie is invented by the unbelievers against Allah, and most of them lack  understanding.[103]
When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has revealed and  come to the Messenger." They reply: "Sufficient for us are the ways on which we  found our forefathers." What! Even though their forefathers knew nothing and were  not rightly guided?[104]
O believers! You are accountable for none but for yourselves; anyone who has gone  astray cannot harm you if you are on the Right Way. To Allah you shall all return and  He will let you know the truth of all that you did.[105]
O believers! When death  approaches any one of you, let two just men from among yourselves act as  witnesses at the time of making your last will; or from the non-Muslims if you are  travelling through the land and the calamity of death overtakes you. If you doubt their  honesty, detain them after prayer and let them both swear by Allah: "We will not sell  our testimony for any price, even to a relative, and we will not hide the testimony  which we will be giving for the sake of Allah; for we shall be sinners if we do so."[106]
Then, if it becomes known that those two were guilty of the sin of perjury, then let two  others better qualified witnesses from among those who were deprived of their right  come forward and testify upon oath, "By Allah, our testimony is truer than theirs. We  have not transgressed in our testimony; for we should be wrongdoers if we did  so."[107]
By this procedure, it is more likely that they will bear true witness or at least  fear that their oaths could be contradicted by subsequent oaths. Have fear of Allah  and listen; Allah does not guide to those who are disobedient transgressors. [108]
On the Day of Resurrection when Allah gathers the Messengers and asks: "What  response were you given from your addressees?" They will say: "We have no  knowledge, only You have all the knowledge of the unseen."[109]
Then Allah will  ask: "O Jesus son of Mary! Recall my favor upon you and to your mother, how I  strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, so you could speak to the people in cradle and  in old age, how I taught you the Book, Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel. How you  were able to make the figure of a bird out of a clay, by My permission, how you  breathed into it and changed it into a real bird, by My permission. How you could heal  the born-blind and the lepers by My permission. How you could bring the dead body  back to life by My permission. How I protected you from the violence of the Children  of Israel when you came to them with clear signs and the unbelievers among them  said: "This is nothing but a clear sorcery."[110]
Remember, when I inspired the  disciples to have faith in Me and My Messenger and they said: ‘We believe and bear  witness that we have become Muslims."[111]
How when the disciples asked: "O  Jesus, son of Mary! Can your Lord send down to us from heaven a table spread with  food?" And you said: "Have fear of Allah if you are true believers."[112]
They said:  "We only wish to eat thereof to satisfy our hearts and to know that you have indeed  told us the truth, and that we bear witness to it."[113]
Jesus, son of Mary said: "O  Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread with food that it may mark a  feast, one of a kind for those before us and for those after us, as a sign from You;  and provide us our sustenance, You are the best Sustainer."[114]
Allah responded: "I  shall send it down to you, but if any of you disbelieve after that, I shall punish him  with a torment which I have never inflicted on anyone in the worlds."[115]
After reminding him of these favors, Allah will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary, Did you  ever say to the people, "worship me and my mother as gods beside Allah?" He will  answer: "Glory to You! How could I say what I had no right to say? If I had ever said  so, you would have certainly known it. You know what is in my heart, but I know not  what is in Yours; for You have full knowledge of all the unseen.[116]
I never said  anything other than what You commanded me to say, that is to worship Allah, Who is  my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness over them as long as I remained among  them; but when You called me off, You were the Watcher over them and You are a  Witness to everything.[117]
If You punish them, they surely are Your servants; and if  You forgive them, You are Mighty, Wise."[118]
Allah will say: "This is the day on  which the truthful will profit from their truth; they shall have gardens beneath which  rivers flow to live therein forever. Allah is well-pleased with them and they are  pleased with Him. This is the mighty achievement."[119]
To Allah belongs the  sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He has power  over everything.[120]
