All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah, and He is the Almighty, the All- Wise.[1]
It is He Who drove the disbelievers from among the People of the Book  (reference is to the Jewish tribe of Banu Al-Nadir) out of their homes at the first  banishment. You did not think that they would ever go out; and they thought that their  fortresses would defend them from Allah, but the wrath of Allah came to them from  where they never expected - which cast such terror into their hearts - that they  destroyed their homes by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers.  So learn a lesson from this example! O people of insight.[2]
Had Allah not decreed  exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world, and in the  hereafter there shall be the punishment of the fire for them,[3]
because they set  themselves up against Allah and His Messenger; and he that sets himself up against  Allah should know that Allah is stern in retribution.[4]
Whatever palm-trees you cut  down or left them standing on their roots, was by the leave of Allah, so that He might  humiliate the transgressors.[5]
As for those spoils of theirs which Allah has bestowed on His Messenger, you  spurred neither cavalry nor camelry to capture them: but Allah gives authority to His  Messengers over whom He pleases, for Allah has power over all things.[6]
Whatever  spoils from the dwellers of the township Allah has bestowed on His Messenger, shall  belong to Allah, His Messenger, Messenger's relatives, and to the orphans, the  needy and the travellers in need; so that it may not become the property of the rich  among you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it and from whatever he forbids  you, refrain from it. Fear Allah; for Allah is stern in retribution.[7]
A share of the spoils  shall be given to the indigent immigrants who were driven out of their homes and  their possessions, and are seeking Allah’s grace and His good pleasure and who  want to help Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the true believers.[8]
A share  of the spoils shall also be given to those who made their abode in Medina (the Ansar)  and believed even before the arrivals of the immigrants and love those who migrated  to them and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to them, and prefer  those immigrants over themselves, even though they themselves are poor. In fact  those who are saved from the greediness of hearts, are the ones who will achieve  true success.[9]
And it is also for those who came after them and say: "Our Lord!  Forgive us and our brothers who embraced the faith before us and do not leave any  malice in our hearts towards the believers. Our Lord! Surely You are the Kind, the  Merciful."[10]
Have you not observed the hypocrites? They say to their fellow unbelievers among  the people of the Book: "If they drive you out, we will go with you. We will never obey  anyone who seeks to harm you. If you are attacked we will certainly help you." Allah  bears witness that they are lying.[11]
If the People of the Book are driven out, they  will never go with them, nor, if the people of the Book are attacked, will they help  them, and even if they help them, they will turn their backs; leaving them with no help  at all.[12]
In their hearts there is greater dread of you than of Allah, because they are  a people devoid of understanding.[13]
They will never fight against you together  except in fortified townships and from behind walls. Strong is their valor amongst  themselves; you think of them united whereas their hearts are divided. This is  because they are a people devoid of wisdom.[14]
Their example is like those who  have tasted, a short while before them, the evil consequences of their deeds. They  shall have a painful punishment.[15]
Their parable is like the Satan who says to man  disbelieve, but when man becomes a disbeliever, he says: "I have nothing to do with  you; I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds."[16]
The end of both will be that they will be  tossed in hell and remain there forever. Thus shall be the reward of the  wrongdoers.[17]
O believers! Fear Allah and let every soul see what it is sending for the morrow  (Hereafter). Fear Allah, surely Allah is aware of all your actions.[18]
Be not like those  who forgot Allah, as a result Allah caused them to forget themselves, it is they who  are the transgressors.[19]
The companions of hell and the companions of paradise  are not equals, of course the companions of paradise are far superior.[20]
If We had sent down this Qur’an on a mountain, you would have seen it humble itself  and split asunder from the fear of Allah, We are citing this example for mankind, so  that they may take heed.[21]
Allah is He, besides Whom there is no god, the Knower of the unseen and the seen.  He is the Compassionate, the Merciful.[22]
Allah is He, besides Whom there is no  god, the King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Granter of security, the Guardian, the  Almighty, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory be to Allah! He is far above the shirk  they commit (by associating other gods with Him).[23]
He is Allah, the Creator, the  Evolver, the Modeler. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and  the earth declares His glory, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.[24]
