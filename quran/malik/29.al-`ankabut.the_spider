Alif Lam M'im.[1]
Do the people think that they will be left alone on saying "We  believe," and that they will not be tested?[2]
We did test those who have gone before  them. Allah has to see (for the purpose of reward and punishment) who are the  truthful and who are the liars.[3]
Or do the evildoers think that they will escape from  Our reach? How bad is their judgment![4]
He that hopes to meet Allah must know  that Allah’s appointed time is sure to come and He hears all and knows all.[5]
He that  strives, does that for his own soul; for Allah is certainly transcendent and beyond any  need of the worlds.[6]
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall  cleanse them of their sins and We shall reward them according to the best of their  deeds.[7]
We have enjoined man to show kindness to his parents; but if they (your parents)  force you to commit shirk with Me, of which you have no knowledge, do not obey  them. To Me is your return and I will inform you of what you have done.[8]
Those  who have accepted the true faith and do good deeds shall be admitted among the  righteous.[9]
There are some among people, who say: "We believe in Allah;" yet  when they suffer in the cause of Allah they confuse the persecution of people with  the punishment of Allah. But when there comes help in the shape of a victory from  your Lord, they are sure to say: "We have always been with you." Is not Allah fully  aware of what is in the hearts of the people of the world.[10]
Most surely Allah knows  those who believe and knows those who are the hypocrites.[11]
The unbelievers say  to the believers: "Follow us, and we will bear the burden of your sins." But they will  not bear any burden of their sins; they are surely lying.[12]
Of course, they shall bear  their own burdens as well as the burdens of others in addition to their own; and on  the Day of Resurrection they shall be questioned about their invented lies.[13]
We sent Noah to his people and he lived among them a thousand years less fifty.  Then because of their wrongdoings the flood overtook them.[14]
But We delivered  him and all who were in the ark and We made that ark a sign for the peoples of the  world.[15]
Likewise Abraham, when he said to his people: "Worship Allah and fear  Him, this is better for you if you understand.[16]
You worship idols besides Allah and  fabricate falsehood. In fact, those whom you worship besides Allah have no power to  give you your sustenance, therefore seek your sustenance from Allah, and worship  Him. Give thanks to Him, for to Him you shall be returned.[17]
If you deny the  Message, then nations have denied before you . The only duty a Messenger has is to  deliver Allah’s Message clearly."[18]
Do they not see how Allah originates creation  then repeats its process? Surely it is easy for Allah.[19]
Say to them: "Travel through  the earth and see how Allah originates the creation, then creates the later creation.  Surely Allah has power over everything.[20]
He punishes whom He wills and shows  mercy to whom He pleases, and to Him you shall be turned back.[21]
Neither can  you frustrate Him in the earth or in the Heaven; nor have you any protector or helper  besides Allah."[22]
As for those who disbelieve Allah’s revelations and deny that they will ever meet Him,  they are the ones who shall despair of My mercy and they are the ones who shall  have a painful punishment.[23]
The people of Abraham had no answer except to say:  "Kill him!" Or "Burn him!" But Allah saved him from the fire when they tried to burn  him. Surely in this incident there are signs for those who believe.[24]
After coming  out from the fire safely, Abraham addressed them: "Today you have made idols,  instead of Allah, a means of affection among yourselves, but remember, on the Day  of Resurrection you shall disown and curse one another. Fire shall be your abode  and you shall have no helper."[25]
Witnessing this whole incident, Lot affirmed his  belief with Abraham. Finally Abraham said: "I will migrate towards my Lord (go where  my Lord has bidden me). He is the Mighty, the Wise."[26]
We gave him Isaac (Isaac  a son) and Jacob (Jacob - a grandson), and placed the Prophethood and the Book in  his progeny - thus We gave him his reward in this life, and in the hereafter he will  surely be among the righteous.[27]
When Lot said to his people: "Surely you are committing such sexual misconduct as  no one in the worlds has ever attempted before you.[28]
Do you lust after males,  commit robbery on the highways and commit evil deeds even in your assemblies?"  His people had no answer except to say: "Bring us the scourge of Allah if you are  truthful."[29]
Lot prayed: "O Lord! Help me against this degenerate nation."[30]
When Our Messengers (angels) came to Abraham with the good news (the birth of a  son in his old age), they said: "We are to destroy the people of that town, for its  people are indeed wrongdoers."[31]
Abraham said: "But Lot is in there." The angels  replied: "We know who is in there: we shall certainly save him and his family, except  his wife, who will remain behind!"[32]
And when Our Messengers (angels) came to  Lot he became sad and anxious on their account, for he felt powerless to protect  them. But they said "Do not fear nor grieve (we are the angels assigned for their  torment): we shall save you and your family except your wife; she will be of those  who will remain behind.[33]
We are going to bring down a scourge from heaven upon  the people of this town on account of their transgression."[34]
Surely We have left a  clear sign from it (the ruins of this town) for people who care to understand.[35]
To the people of Madyan We sent their brother Shu‘aib, who said: "O my people!  Worship Allah and look forward to the Last Day, and do not transgress in the land  wickedly."[36]
But they denied him, so a severe earthquake seized them and by the  morning they were lifeless bodies in their own homes.[37]
Likewise We destroyed the  people of ‘Ad and the Thamud: you have seen the traces of their dwellings. Satan  had made their foul deeds fair-seeming to them and diverted them from the Right  Way, though they were intelligent people.[38]
Moses came to Qarun (Korah),  Pharoah (Pharaoh) and Haman with clear signs but they remained arrogant in the  land; yet they could not go ahead of Us.[39]
We seized all of them for their  sinfulness: against some We sent a violent tornado full of stones, some were seized  by a mighty blast, some were swallowed up by the earth, and yet some We drowned.  It was not Allah Who was unjust to them, but they were unjust to their own souls.[40]
The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a spider who  builds for itself a dwelling, and surely the weakest of all dwellings is the dwelling of a  spider, if they but knew it.[41]
Surely Allah knows whoever they invoke besides Him;  He is the All-Mighty, the Wise.[42]
These are the parables that We cite for mankind;  but none will grasp them except the wise.[43]
Allah has created the heavens and the  earth to manifest the Truth. Surely in this there is a sign for the believers.[44]
Recite from this Book (Al-Qur'an) which has been revealed to you and establish  Salah (Islamic prayers). Surely Salah keeps one away from shameful and evil deeds;  and surely the remembrance of Allah (and Allah’s mention of your name in front of  the angels) is the greatest indeed, Allah knows what you do.[45]
Do not argue with  the People of the Book except in good taste - except with those who are wicked  among them - and say: "We believe in that which is sent down to us and that which is  sent down to you; Our God and your God is the same One God to Whom we submit  as Muslims."[46]
O Prophet, We have sent down this Book to you (similar to that of  Moses and Jesus). So the People of the Book believe in it, and so do some of these  (people of Arabia): and none but unbelievers deny Our revelations.[47]
O  Muhammad, you have never read a book before this nor have you ever transcribed  one with your right hand. Had you done either of these, the quibblers could suspect  it.[48]
Rather, these are clear signs in the breast of those who are endowed with  knowledge: and none deny Our signs except the wrongdoers.[49]
They ask: "Why  have the signs not been sent down to him from his Lord?" Tell them: "The signs are  in the hands of Allah. I am only a plain Warner."[50]
Is it not enough for them that We  have sent down to you this Book (AL-Qur’an) which is recited to them, surely in it is a  blessing and a reminder for those who believe.[51]
Tell them: "Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you - for He knows all that  is in the heavens and the earth - those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve Allah,  it is they who shall be the losers."[52]
They challenge you to hasten the scourge on  them. Had a time not been fixed for it, the scourge would already have overtaken  them. It is going to come suddenly and catch them unaware.[53]
They challenge you  to hasten the scourge, whereas hell has already encircled the unbelievers.[54]
On  that Day the punishment shall cover them from above and from beneath their feet,  and Allah will say: "Now taste the reward of your deeds."[55]
O My servants who  have believed! Surely My earth is spacious to migrate if needed, therefore worship  Me and Me Alone.[56]
Every soul shall taste death, then to Us you shall all  return.[57]
Those who embrace true faith and do good deeds shall be lodged in the  mansions of paradise beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. What an  excellent reward for the doers of good deeds;[58]
the ones who have shown patience  and put their trust in their Lord.[59]
How many creatures are there that do not carry  their provisions with them? Allah provides for them as He provides for you. It is He  Who is All-hearing, All-knowing.[60]
If you ask the disbelievers as to who has created  the heavens and the earth, and subjected the sun and the moon to His laws? They  will certainly say: "Allah!" How are they then being deluded away from the truth?[61]
Allah gives abundantly to whom He pleases and sparingly to whom He wills; surely  Allah has knowledge of all things.[62]
And if you ask them who sends down rainwater  from the sky and thereby raises the dead land back to life?" They will certainly say:  "Allah!" Say, "Praise be to Allah!" Yet most of them do not use their common  sense.[63]
The life of this world is nothing but a pastime and play! It is the life of the hereafter  that is the true life, if they but knew it.[64]
If they embark on a ship, and the ship gets  into trouble, they call upon Allah, being sincerely obedient to Him; but when He  brings them safely to land, they start committing shirk (giving credit for their safe  arrival to others);[65]
so that they may become ungrateful for the blessing that We  have bestowed on them and enjoy the life of this world! They will soon come to know  the result of this behavior.[66]
Do they not see that We have made for them a secure  sanctuary in the Ka'bah, while the people are being snatched away from all around  them? Do they still believe in falsehood and deny the blessings of Allah?[67]
And  who is more wicked than the one who forges a lie against Allah or rejects the Truth  when it reaches him? Is not the hell a fitting abode for such disbelievers?[68]
As for  those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them to Our ways; rest assured  that Allah is with the righteous.[69]
