Allah has indeed heard the words of the woman (Khawlah daughter of Tha‘labah,  who had been divorced by calling her: ‘‘You are to me like my mother" which was an  acceptable practice for divorce among pagan Arabs), who pleaded with you against  her husband and made her complaint to Allah, and Allah has heard what you said to  each other. Allah hears all and sees all.[1]
Those of you who divorce their wives by  ZihAr (calling them to be like their mothers) should know that they are not their  mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. Surely the words they  utter are absurd and false. Allah could punish them for this but He forgave them,  surely Allah is All-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.[2]
Those who divorce their wives by  ZihAr, then wish to retract the words they uttered, shall have to free a slave before  they touch each other. This is enjoined as a penalty for doing so. Allah is well-aware  of all your actions.[3]
He that has no slave, shall fast two consecutive months before  they touch each other. He that cannot fast, shall feed sixty poor people. This is  enjoined so that you may have faith in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits  set by Allah, and the violators shall have a painful punishment.[4]
Those who resist  Allah and His Messenger, shall be humiliated as were those before them. We have  sent down clear revelations; the disbelievers shall have a humiliating punishment.[5]
On the Day of Judgment Allah will raise them all back to life, then inform them about  what they have done. Allah has kept full record of their deeds even though they may  have forgotten, for Allah is a witness over all things.[6]
Are you not aware that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth? It  cannot be that three persons converse in secret and He is not the fourth of them; or  five persons converse in secret and He is not the sixth of them; whether fewer or  more, wherever they may be, He is with them. Then on the Day of Resurrection He  will inform them of what they have done, surely Allah has knowledge of all things.[7]
Have you not seen those who, though forbidden to hold secret counsels, persistently  do what was forbidden? They hold secret counsels among themselves for sin,  hostility and disobedience to the Messenger. Yet when they come to you, they greet  you in words which Allah does not greet you with, and say to themselves: "Why does  Allah not punish us for what we say?" Hell is enough for them, they shall burn in its  flames, what an evil destination![8]
O believers! When you confer together in private,  do not talk about sin and hostility and disobedience to the Messenger; but to counsel  about virtue and piety, and fear Allah, before whom you shall be brought together.[9]
Conspiring in secret is the work of Satan, who means to vex the believers; but he  cannot harm them at all except as Allah permits; so in Allah let the believers put their  trust.[10]
O believers! When you are asked to make room in your meetings, make  room, Allah will make room for you in the Hereafter. And if you are told to rise up,  then rise up: Allah will raise to higher ranks those of you who have faith and  knowledge. Allah is aware of all your actions.[11]
O believers! When you want to  consult the Messenger in private, offer something in charity before your consultation,  that is best and purest for you. But if you lack the means, know that Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.[12]
Do you hesitate to give out in charity before your private  consultation with him? If you cannot afford it - Allah will forgive you - so establish  Salah and pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is well aware of all  your actions.[13]
Have you not seen the ones who have befriended those people who are under the  wrath of Allah? They are neither on your side nor yet on theirs and they knowingly  swear to falsehood.[14]
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment; evil  indeed is what they are doing.[15]
They use their oaths as shields, and debar others  from the Way of Allah. They shall have a humiliating punishment.[16]
Neither their  riches nor their sons shall avail them anything against Allah. They shall be the  inmates of hell and live there forever.[17]
On the Day when Allah will raise them all to  life, they will swear to Him as they now swear to you, thinking that their oaths will  help them. By no means! Surely they are the liars.[18]
Satan has gained possession  of them, and caused them to forget Allah’s warning. They are the party of Satan.  Beware! Surely it is the party of Satan that shall be the loser.[19]
Those who resist  Allah and His Messenger will be among the most humiliated.[20]
Allah has decreed:  "It is I and My Messengers who will most certainly prevail." Surely Allah is All- Powerful, All-Mighty.[21]
You will never find any people who believe in Allah and the  last Day on friendly terms with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even  though they be their fathers, their sons, their brothers or their relatives. It is they in  whose hearts Allah has inscribed faith and has strengthened them with a spirit of His  own. He will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever.  Allah will be well pleased with them, and they will be well pleased with Him. They are  the party of Allah. Beware! Surely it is the party of Allah that will be successful.[22]
