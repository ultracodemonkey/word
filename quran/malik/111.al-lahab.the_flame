Perish the hands of Abu Lahab! And perish he![1]
His wealth and whatever he  earned did not avail him anything.[2]
Soon he shall be burnt in a flaming fire (a pun  on the meaning of Abu Lahab, "father of flames"),[3]
and his wife, the carrier of  crackling fire wood,[4]
shall have a rope of palm-leaf fibre around her neck.[5]
