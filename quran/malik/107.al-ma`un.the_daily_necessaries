Have you seen the one who denies the Day of Judgment?[1]
He it is who drives  away the orphan with harshness[2]
and does not encourage the feeding of the  poor.[3]
So woe to those who offer Salah (prayers),[4]
but are neglectful of their  Salah (offer Prayers but disregard the very purpose of establishing Salah - to have  the fear of Allah and be mindful to the needs of other people);[5]
those who make a  show of piety[6]
and refuse to share the necessities of life.[7]
