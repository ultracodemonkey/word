When the earth will be shaken to her utmost convulsion,[1]
and the earth shall bring  out all her inner burdens,[2]
man shall say: "What is happening to her?"[3]
On that  Day she shall report whatever had happened on her,[4]
for your Lord shall have  commanded her to do so.[5]
On that Day men shall proceed in sorted out groups to  be shown their ‘Book of Deeds.’[6]
Then, whoever has done an atom’s weight of  good shall see it there,[7]
and whoever has done an atom’s weight of evil shall see it  there.[8]
