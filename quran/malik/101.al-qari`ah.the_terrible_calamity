The Qariah![1]
What is the Qariah?[2]
And what will explain to you what the Qariah  is?[3]
It is that Day when men shall be like scattered moths[4]
and the mountains like  colorful carded wool.[5]
On that Day, he whose scale of good deeds is heavy,[6]
shall live a pleasant luxurious life.[7]
But he whose scale of good deeds is light[8]
shall abode in Haviah;[9]
and what will explain to you, what it (Haviah) is?[10]
It is a  blazing fire.[11]
