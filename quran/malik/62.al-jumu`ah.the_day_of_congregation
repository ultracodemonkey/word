62 AL-JUMU’AH - FRIDAY  In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the merciful  All that is in the heavens and earth declares the glory of Allah, the King, the Holy, the  Mighty, the Wise.[1]
It is He Who has raised among the unlettered people a  Messenger of their own, who recites to them His revelations, purifies them, and  teaches them the Book and Wisdom, though prior to this they were in gross error,[2]
he is also sent for others of them who have not yet joined them (become Muslims).  He is the Mighty, the Wise.[3]
That is the grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom  pleases. Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.[4]
The example of those who were charged with the Torah, but failed to carry out their  obligations, is that of a donkey who is carrying books and does not know what is in  those books. Bad is the example of those who deny the revelations of Allah. Allah  does not guide the wrongdoers.[5]
O you, the Jews! If you claim that you are the  favorites of Allah to the exclusion of other people, then wish for death if what you say  is true. [6]
But, because of what their hands have sent before them for the hereafter,  they will never wish for death. Allah knows these wrongdoers very well.[7]
Tell them:  "The death from which you are running away, will surely overtake you: then you will  be sent back to Him Who knows the unseen and the seen; and He will tell you all that  you have been doing."[8]
O believers! When the call for Salah (prayer) is made on Friday (the day of  congregational prayers), hasten to the remembrance of Allah and cease your  business. That is better for you if you but knew.[9]
When you finish the Salah, then  disperse through the land and seek the bounty of Allah (go back to your normal  business). Remember Allah frequently, so that you may prosper.[10]
Those who are  still weak in ImAn (faith), when they see some bargain or some sport they rush to it  and leave you standing. O Prophet declare to them that what Allah has in store for  them is far better than any sport and bargain, and Allah is the best provider.[11]
