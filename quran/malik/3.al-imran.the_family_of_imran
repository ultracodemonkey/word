Alif L'am M'im[1]
Allah! There is no god but Him; the Living, the Eternal.[2]
He has  revealed to you this Book with the Truth, confirming the scripture which preceded it,  as He revealed the Torah and Gospel,[3]
before this, as a guidance for mankind and  also revealed this Al-Furqan (criterion for judgment between right and wrong). Surely  those who reject Allah’s revelations will be sternly punished; Allah is Mighty, capable  of retribution.[4]
For sure nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from  Allah.[5]
It is He Who shapes your bodies in the wombs of your mothers as He  pleases. There is no god but Him; the Mighty, the Wise.[6]
He is the One Who has revealed to you the Book. Some of its verses are decisive they  are the foundation of the Book - while others are allegorical. Those whose  hearts are infected with disbelief follow the allegorical part to mislead others and to  give it their own interpretation, seeking for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its  hidden meanings except Allah. Those who are well grounded in knowledge say: "We  believe in it; it is all from our Lord." None will take heed except the people of  understanding.[7]
They say: "Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate from the truth  after you have guided us, and grant us Your own mercy; You are the Grantor of  bounties without measure.[8]
Our Lord, You will surely gather all mankind before You  on the Day about which there is no doubt; surely Allah does not break His  promise."[9]
Surely neither their wealth nor their children will save the unbelievers from the wrath  of Allah: they are the ones who will become the fuel for hellfire.[10]
Their end will be  the same as that of the people of Pharaoh and their predecessors who denied Our  revelations, so Allah called them to account for their sins. Allah is strict in  retribution.[11]
O Muhammad, say to the unbelievers: "Soon you will be overpowered  and driven together to Hell - which is a horrible refuge.[12]
Indeed there was a sign  (lesson) for you in the two armies which met on the battlefield (of Badr): one was  fighting for the cause of Allah and the other had rejected Allah; the believers saw with  their own eyes that the unbelievers were twice their number. But the result of the  battle proved that Allah strengthens with His own aid whom He pleases. Surely there  is a lesson in this for those who have sight.[13]
The life of men is tempted by love and desire for women, children, the hoarding of  treasures of gold and silver, branded horses, wealth of cattle and plantations. These  are the comforts for the transitory life of this world; the everlasting best comfort,  however, is with Allah.[14]
Say : "Shall I tell you of better things than these, with  which the righteous will be rewarded by their Lord? There will be gardens beneath  which rivers flow, where they will live forever with spouses of perfect chastity and the  good pleasure of Allah. Allah is watching His servants very closely."[15]
The  righteous people are those who pray: "Our Lord! We sincerely believe in You: please  forgive our sins and save us from the agony of the hellfire;"[16]
who are steadfast,  sincere, obedient, and charitable, and who pray for forgiveness in the morning  time.[17]
Allah Himself has testified to the fact that there is no god but Him and so do the  angels and those who are well grounded in knowledge standing firm on justice. There  is no Ilah (God) except Him, the Mighty, the Wise.[18]
Surely the only Deen (true  religion and the Right Way of life) in the sight of Allah is Al-Islam. Those to whom the  Book was given did not adopt ways different than this except out of envy among  themselves, and after true knowledge had come to them. They should know that  Allah is swift in calling to account those who deny His revelations.[19]
So if they  argue with you (O Muhammad), tell them: "I have submitted myself entirely to Allah  and so have those who follow me." Then ask those who are given the Book and  those who are illiterate: "Will you also submit yourselves to Allah?" If they become  Muslims they shall be rightly guided but if they turn back, you need not worry,  because your sole responsibility is to convey the Message. Allah is watching all His  servants very closely.[20]
Give a warning to those who deny Allah’s revelations, who slay the Prophets without  any justification, and who kill those from among the people who enjoin justice, that  there is a painful punishment for them.[21]
They are the ones whose deeds will  become void in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.[22]
Have you not seen the behavior of those (Jews) who have been given a portion of  the Book? When they are invited to settle their disputes according to the Book of  Allah, some of them turn back and decline.[23]
This is because they say: "The fire of  Hell shall not touch us; even if it does, it will be for a few days." In their religion they  are deceived by their own self-invented beliefs.[24]
What will they do when We will  gather them together on the Day which is sure to come, when every soul will be  given what it has earned and there shall be no injustice?[25]
Say: "O Allah! Master of all the Kingship, You give the kingdom to whom You please  and take away the kingdom from whomsoever You please; You give honor to whom  You please and disgrace whom You please; all the good is in Your hand; surely You  have power over everything.[26]
You cause the night to pass into the day and You  cause the day to pass into the night; You draw the living from the dead and You draw  the dead from the living; and You provide sustenance for anyone You wish without  measure."[27]
Let not the believers make unbelievers their protectors rather than the believers;  anyone who does so will have nothing to hope for from Allah - except if you do so as  a precaution to guard yourselves against their tyranny. Anyhow, Allah warns you to  fear Him: because with Allah is your final refuge.[28]
Say: "Whether you conceal  what is in your heart or reveal it, it is known to Allah.[29]
He knows whatever is in the  heavens and whatever is in the earth. Allah has full power over everything. On the  Day of Judgment, when every soul will be confronted with whatever good it has done  - as for its evil deeds, it will wish they were a long way off. Allah cautions you to  beware of Him. Allah is full of kindness towards His devotees.[30]
Tell the people O Muhammad: "If you sincerely love Allah, then follow me; Allah will  also love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."[31]
Also tell  them, "Obey Allah and His Messenger." Inspite of this, if they turn back, then warn  them, that Allah does not love the disbelievers.[32]
Indeed Allah exalted Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham and the family of Imran  above all the worlds.[33]
They were the offsprings of one another. Allah hears all and  knows all.[34]
Allah heard when the wife of `Imran said, "O my Lord! I dedicate to Your service what  is in my womb. Please accept it from me. You Alone hear all and know all."[35]
When  she gave birth to a girl instead of a boy, she said: "My Lord! I have given birth to a  girl," - Allah knew very well what she had delivered - "and that the male is not like the  female, I have named her Mary and I seek Your protection for her and her children  from the mischief of Satan, the accursed."[36]
Her Lord graciously accepted that girl.  He made her grow up as a good girl and entrusted her to the care of Zakariya.  Whenever Zakariya entered the sanctuary to see her, he found with her food. He  asked, "O Mary! From where did you get it?" She replied, "It came from Allah. In fact,  Allah gives to whom He wants without measure."[37]
Thereupon Zakariya prayed to his Lord saying: "O my Lord! Grant me a righteous  child as Your special favor; surely You hear all prayers."[38]
As he stood praying in  the Mahrab (a prayer place in the sanctuary) the angels called out to him saying:  "Allah gives you good news of a son to be named John, he will confirm the word of  Allah, he will be a great leader, chaste and a Prophet from among the righteous."[39]
He said: "O my Lord! How can I have a son now that I have reached an old age and  my wife is barren?" "Such is the will of Allah" he replied, " Allah does what He  wants."[40]
Zakariya said: "My Lord! Grant me a sign." It was said: "Your sign is that  you will not be able to speak to people for three days except through gestures.  During this time you should remember your Lord very much and glorify Him in the  evening and in the morning."[41]
There came the time when angels said: "O Mary! Surely Allah has exalted you,  purified you, and preferred you for His service over all the women of the worlds.[42]
O Mary! Be obedient to your Lord, prostrate and bow down in worship with other  worshippers."[43]
O Muhammad, this is the news from the Unseen which We are  revealing to you. You were not present with them when priests of the temple cast  their pens to decide which of them should be the guardian of Mary; nor were you with  them when they argued about it.[44]
When the angels said "O Mary! Allah gives you the good news with a Word from Him  that you will be given a son: his name will be Messiah, Jesus (Jesus Christ) the son  of Mary. He will be noble in this world and the Hereafter; and he will be from those  who are very close to Allah. [45]
He will speak to the people in the cradle and in his  old age and he will be among the righteous."[46]
Hearing this, Mary said, "O my Lord! How can I have a son when no man has ever  touched me?" He replied, "Even so, Allah creates however He wants; whenever He  decides to do anything, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is![47]
Allah will teach your son  the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel[48]
and send him forth as a  Messenger to the Children of Israel with this message: 'I have brought you signs of  my appointment from your Lord. I will make for you the likeness of a bird from clay; I  will breathe into it and, with Allah’s leave, it will become a living bird. I will heal the  blind and the lepers, and raise the dead to life, by Allah's leave. Furthermore, I will  tell you what you have eaten and what you have stored in your houses. Surely these  are the signs to convince you if you are believers.[49]
I am appointed to confirm that  which is before me from the Torah and to make lawful to you some of the things  forbidden to you. Now I have brought you the signs from your Lord, therefore fear  Allah and obey me.[50]
In fact, Allah is my Lord as well as your Lord, therefore,  worship Him; this is the Right Way.'"[51]
When Jesus found out that they (most of the children of Israel) had no faith, he  asked: "Who will help me in the cause of Allah?" The Disciples replied: "We will help  you in the cause of Allah. We believe in Allah. Be our witness that we are  Muslims."[52]
Then they invoked Allah and said): "Our Lord! We believe in what you  have revealed and we follow Your Messenger. Please count us with those who bear  witness."[53]
The unbelievers among the children of Israel plotted against Jesus and Allah also  devised a plan to raise him up, and Allah is the best in planning.[54]
Allah said: "O Jesus! I am going to recall you (from your mission) and raise you up to  Myself. I will clean you of those who rejected you and exalt your followers above the  unbelievers until the Day of Resurrection; then to Me shall be your return and I shall  judge those matters in which you have been disputing.[55]
Those who are  unbelievers will be punished with severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter;  they shall have no helpers.[56]
As for those who believe and do good deeds, Allah  will pay them their full reward. Allah does not love the transgressors."[57]
This revelation which We recite to you is full of signs and wise reminders.[58]
In fact,  the example of the birth of Jesus ( Jesus) in the sight of Allah is like the example of  Adam who had no father and mother, whom He created out of dust, then said to him:  "Be" and he was.[59]
This is the Truth from your Lord, therefore, do not be of those  who doubt it.[60]
If anyone disputes with you concerning this matter (the birth of  Jesus) after full knowledge has come to you, say: "Come! Let us gather our sons and  your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: then let us  earnestly pray and invoke the curse of Allah on the liars."[61]
Verily this is the  absolute true explanation. The fact of the matter is, that there is no god but Allah; and  for sure Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.[62]
But if they turn away from accepting this  challenge, it will be clear proof of their mischief and Allah has full knowledge of  mischief-mongers.[63]
Say: "O people of the Book! Let us get together on what is common between us and  you: that we shall worship none but Allah; that we shall not associate any partners  with Him; that we shall not take from among ourselves any lords beside Allah." If they  reject your invitation then tell them: "Bear witness that we are Muslims (who have  surrendered to Allah)."[64]
O people of the Book! Why do you argue with us about  Abraham, as to whether he was a Jew or a Christian? You know that the Torah and  the Gospel were revealed long after him? Have you no sense at all?[65]
So far you  have been arguing about things of which you had some knowledge! Must you now  argue about that of which you know nothing at all? Allah knows while you do not.[66]
Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian but he was a Muslim, true in faith. He  was not one of the Pagans (who set up partners with Allah).[67]
Surely the people  nearest to Abraham are those who follow him, which are this Prophet (Muhammad)  and those who believe with him; Allah is the Protector of only those who are the  believers.[68]
Some of the People of the Book want to mislead you; but they mislead  none except themselves, though they do not realize it.[69]
O People of the Book!  Why do you deny the revelations of Allah when you know that they are true?[70]
O  People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood and knowingly  conceal the truth?[71]
Some of the People of the Book say to one another: "Believe in what is revealed to  the believers (Muslims) in the morning and deny it in the evening; so that they (the  Muslims) may follow suit and abandon their faith.[72]
Do not follow anyone except  the one who follows your own religion." O Muhammad, tell them: "The only true  guidance is the guidance of Allah." These people of the Book do not believe that  revelation could be sent to anyone besides themselves, like that which has been sent  to you; or that they will ever argue with you in the presence of your Lord. Tell them:  "For sure, grace is in the hands of Allah: He bestows it on whom He pleases; Allah  has boundless knowledge."[73]
He chooses for His mercy whom He pleases, Allah is  the Owner of mighty grace.[74]
Among the People of the Book there are some who, if you trust them with a heap of  gold, will readily return it back; and there are others who, if you trust them with a  single dinar (silver coin) will not return it back unless you constantly keep on  demanding; because they say, "We are not going to be called to account for our  behavior with the illiterates (non Jews or Christians)." Thus they deliberately ascribe  a lie to Allah -knowing well that He never permitted such wrongdoing.[75]
In fact,  those who keep their promise and guard themselves against evil are His beloved, for  Allah loves only those who guard themselves against such evils.[76]
In fact, those  who sell the covenants of Allah and their own oaths for a petty price, shall have no  portion in the hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them nor even look at them nor  cleanse them from their sins on the Day of Judgment. They shall have painful  punishment.[77]
There are some among them who twist their tongues pretending a  quote from their Holy Book; so that you may think that what they read is a part of the  Book, whereas, in fact it is not a part of the Book. They also assert, "It is from Allah"  whereas, in fact it is not from Allah. Thus they deliberately ascribe a lie to Allah.[78]
It is not possible for a man whom Allah has given the Book, the Wisdom and the  Prophethood, that he would say to the people: "Worship me instead of Allah." On the  contrary he would say: "Be devoted worshippers of your Lord in accordance with the  Holy Book you have been teaching and reading."[79]
He would never ask you to take  angels and prophets as your lords. Would he ask you to become kafir (unbeliever)  after you have become Muslim (believer)?[80]
Allah took a covenant with the Prophets, saying: "Now that you have been given the  Book and Wisdom; there will come to you a Messenger who will confirm that which is  with you, you will have to believe in him and help him in his mission." Then He said  "Do you affirm this covenant and agree to take this heavy responsibility?" The  Prophets replied, "Yes, we do affirm." Allah said, "Very well, bear witness to this and I  too bear witness with you."[81]
Now if anyone turns back after this, he will become  the transgressor.[82]
Are they looking for a religion other than the Deen (religion and Way of Life) of Allah  knowing well that everything in the heavens and in the earth, willingly or unwillingly,  has submitted to Him? And to Him they shall all return.[83]
O Prophet, say: "We  believe in Allah and what is revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham,  Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants; and in that which was given to Moses,  Jesus and other Prophets from their Lord; we do not discriminate between any one of  them, and to Allah do we submit in Islam."[84]
If anyone is looking for a religion other  than Islam, then let it be known that it will not be accepted from him; and in the  Hereafter he will be among the losers.[85]
How can it be that Allah would guide those people who commit Kufr (reject faith) after  their Iman (acceptance of faith), acknowledge that the Messenger is true, and clear  proofs have come to them? Allah does not guide such wrongdoers.[86]
The reward  of such people is that upon them is the curse of Allah, the angels and all  mankind.[87]
They shall remain under it forever; neither will their punishment be  lightened nor will they be given respite.[88]
However, those who repent after this and  mend their ways, verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.[89]
However, those who  disbelieve after their belief (acceptance of Islam) then go on adding to their disbelief,  their repentance will never be accepted; because they intentionally chose to go  astray.[90]
As to those who are unbelievers and die while they were unbelievers, if  they were to fill the whole earth with gold and offer it as a ransom for each one of  them, that would not be accepted. These are the ones who shall have the painful  punishment, and shall have no helpers.[91]
You can never attain righteousness unless you spend in the cause of Allah that which you dearly cherish; and whatever you spend surely it is known to Allah.
All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel (Jacob) made unlawful for himself, before the Torah (of Moses) was revealed. Say: "Bring ye the Torah and study it, if ye be men of truth." [3:93]
If any, after this, invent a lie and attribute it to Allah, they are indeed unjust wrong-doers. [3:94]
Say: "Allah speaketh the Truth: follow the religion of Abraham, the sane in faith; he was not of the Pagans." [3:95]
The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka: Full of blessing and of guidance for all the worlds. [3:96]
In it are Signs Manifest; (for example), the Station of Abraham; whoever enters it attains security; Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah,- those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith, Allah stands not in need of any of His creatures. [3:97]
Say: "O People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, when Allah is Himself witness to all ye do?" [3:98]
Say: "O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe, from the path of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while ye were yourselves witnesses (to Allah's Covenant)? But Allah is not unmindful of all that ye do." [3:99]
O ye who believe! If ye listen to a faction among the People of the Book, they would (indeed) render you apostates after ye have believed! [3:100]
And how would ye deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs of Allah, and among you lives the Messenger. Whoever holds firmly to Allah will be shown a way that is straight. [3:101]
O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islám. [3:102]
And hold fast, all together, by the Rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah's favor on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you that ye may be guided. [3:103]
Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity. [3:104]
Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty,- [3:105]
On the Day when some faces will be (lit up with) white, and some faces will be (in the gloom of) black: To those whose faces will be black, (will be said): "Did ye reject Faith after accepting it? Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith." [3:106]
But those whose faces will be (lit with) white,- they will be in (the light of) Allah's mercy: therein to dwell (for ever). [3:107]
These are the Signs of Allah. We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And Allah means no injustice to any of His creatures. [3:108]
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Allah matters return. [3:109]
Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors. [3:110]
They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out to fight you, they will show you their backs, and no help shall they get. [3:111]
Shame is pitched over them (like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds. [3:112]
Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (for the right): They rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. [3:113]
They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous. [3:114]
Of the good that they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knoweth well those that do right. [3:115]
Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah. They will be companions of the Fire,- dwelling therein (for ever). [3:116]
What they spend in the life of this (material) world may be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them, but they wrong themselves. [3:117]
O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire for you to suffer: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom. [3:118]
Ah! ye are those who love them, but they love you not,- though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe": But when they are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: "Perish in your rage; Allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart." [3:119]
If aught that is good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if ye are patient and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do. [3:120]
(Remember that morning) thou didst leave thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things: [3:121]
Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice; but Allah was their protector, and in Allah should the faithful (ever) put their trust. [3:122]
Allah had helped you at Badr, when ye were a contemptible little force; then fear Allah. thus may ye show your gratitude. [3:123]
Remember thou saidst to the faithful: "Is it not enough for you that Allah should help you with three thousand angels (Specially) sent down?" [3:124]
Yea, - if ye remain firm, and act aright, even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste, your Lord would help you with five thousand angels clearly marked. [3:125]
Allah made it but a message of hope for you, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah. The Exalted, the Wise: [3:126]
That He might cut off a fringe of the unbelievers or expose them to infamy, and they should then be turned back, frustrated of their purpose. [3:127]
Not for thee, (but for Allah), is the decision: Whether He turn in mercy to them, or punish them; for they are indeed wrong-doers. [3:128]
To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth; but Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [3:129]
O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; but fear Allah. that ye may (really) prosper. [3:130]
And fear the Fire, which is repaired for those who reject Faith: [3:131]
And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy. [3:132]
Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose width is that (of the whole) of the heavens and of the earth, prepared for the righteous,- [3:133]
Those who spend (freely), whether in prosperity, or in adversity; who restrain anger, and pardon (all) men;- for Allah loves those who do good;- [3:134]
And those who, having done an act of indecency to be ashamed of, or wronged their own souls, remember Allah, and ask for forgiveness for their sins,- and who can forgive sins except Allah? - and are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in (the wrong) they have done. [3:135]
For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath,- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive)! [3:136]
There have been examples that have passed away before you: Travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth. [3:137]
Here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those who fear Allah. [3:138]
So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith. [3:139]
If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others. Such days (of varying fortunes) We give to men and men by turns: that Allah may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from your ranks martyr-witnesses (to truth). And Allah loveth not those that do wrong. [3:140]
Allah's object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing those that resist Faith. [3:141]
Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without Allah testing those of you who fought hard (In His Cause) and remained steadfast? [3:142]
Ye did indeed wish for death before ye met him: Now ye have seen it with your own eyes, (and ye flinch!) [3:143]
Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many were the a messengers that passed away before him. Is it that if he died or were slain, will ye then turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah. But Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude. [3:144]
Nor can a soul die except by Allah's leave, the term being fixed as by writing. If any do desire a reward in this life, We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve us with) gratitude. [3:145]
How many of the prophets fought (in Allah's way), and with them (fought) large bands of godly men? But they never lost heart if they met with disaster in Allah's way, nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And Allah Loves those who are firm and steadfast. [3:146]
All that they said was: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything we may have done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly, and help us against those that resist Faith." [3:147]
And Allah gave them a reward in this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah Loves those who do good. [3:148]
O ye who believe! If ye obey the unbelievers, they will drive you back on your heels, and ye will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss. [3:149]
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers. [3:150]
Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers! [3:151]
Allah did indeed fulfill His promise to you when ye with His permission were about to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you But He forgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe. [3:152]
Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a side glance at any one, and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. There did Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital, to teach you not to grieve for (the booty) that had escaped you and for (the ill) that had befallen you. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do. [3:153]
After (the excitement) of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings, moved by wrong suspicions of Allah - suspicions due to ignorance. They said: "What affair is this of ours?" Say thou: "Indeed, this affair is wholly Allah's." They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): "If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts. [3:154]
Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met,-it was Satan who caused them to fail, because of some (evil) they had done. But Allah Has blotted out (their fault): For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. [3:155]
O ye who believe! Be not like the unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are traveling through the earth or engaged in fighting: "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain." This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do. [3:156]
And if ye are slain, or die, in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all they could amass : [3:157]
And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are brought together. [3:158]
It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them. Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (their faults), and ask for (Allah's) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then, when thou hast taken a decision put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him). [3:159]
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you: If He forsakes you, who is there, after that, that can help you? In Allah, then, let believers put their trust. [3:160]
No prophet could (ever) be false to his trust. If any person is so false, He shall, on the Day of Judgment, restore what he misappropriated; then shall every soul receive its due,- whatever it earned,- and none shall be dealt with unjustly. [3:161]
Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah like the man who draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and whose abode is in Hell?- A woeful refuge! [3:162]
They are in varying grades in the sight of Allah, and Allah sees well all that they do. [3:163]
Allah did confer a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah, sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, while, before that, they had been in manifest error. [3:164]
What! When a single disaster smites you, although ye smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, do ye say?- "Whence is this?" Say (to them): "It is from yourselves: For Allah hath power over all things." [3:165]
What ye suffered on the day the two armies met, was with the leave of Allah, in order that He might test the believers,- [3:166]
And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (the foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known there would be a fight, we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts. But Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal. [3:167]
(They are) the ones that say, (of their brethren slain), while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth." [3:168]
Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord; [3:169]
They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah. And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve. [3:170]
They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah, and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least). [3:171]
Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger, even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward;- [3:172]
Those to whom men said: "A great army is gathering against you, so fear them!". But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: "For us Allah sufficeth, and He is the best Guardian." [3:173]
And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah.: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded. [3:174]
It is only Satan suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them, but fear Me, if ye have faith. [3:175]
Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to Allah. Allah's plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment. [3:176]
Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith,- not the least harm will they do to Allah, but they will have a grievous punishment. [3:177]
Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment. [3:178]
Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now, until He separates what is evil from what is good. Nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers (for the purpose) whom He pleases. So believe in Allah, and His messengers: And if ye believe and do right, ye have a great reward (without measure). [3:179]
And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace, think that it is good for them: Nay, it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks like a twisted collar, on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do. [3:180]
Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly, Allah is indigent and we are rich!"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: "Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire!" [3:181]
This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never do injustice to His servants. [3:182]
They (also) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in a messenger unless he showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (from heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth?" [3:183]
Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, The Scriptures, and the Book of Enlightenment. [3:184]
Every soul shall have the taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have succeeded: For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception. [3:185]
Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship partners besides Allah. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be of great resolution. [3:186]
And remember Allah took a Covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made! [3:187]
Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not that they can escape the penalty. For them is a penalty grievous indeed. [3:188]
To Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah hath power over all things. [3:189]
Behold! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day,- there are indeed Signs for men of understanding,- [3:190]
Men who celebrate the praises of Allah, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth, (with the thought): "Our Lord! Not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the Chastisement of the Fire." [3:191]
Our Lord! any whom Thou dost admit to the Fire, truly Thou coverest with shame, and never will wrong-doers find any helpers! [3:192]
Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling (us) to Faith, 'Believe ye in the Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out from us our iniquities, and take to Thyself our souls in the company of the righteous. [3:193]
Our Lord! Grant us what Thou didst promise unto us through Thine messengers, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment: For Thou never breakest Thy promise. [3:194]
And their Lord hath accepted of them, and answered them: "Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: Ye are members, one of another: Those who have left their homes, or been driven out therefrom, or suffered harm in My Cause, or fought or been slain,- verily, I will blot out from them their iniquities, and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath;- A reward from Allah, and from Allah is the best of rewards." [3:195]
Let not the strutting about of the unbelievers through the land deceive thee: [3:196]
Little is it for enjoyment: Their ultimate abode is Hell: what an evil bed (to lie on)! [3:197]
On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever),- a gift from Allah; and that which is from Allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous. [3:198]
And there are, certainly, among the People of the Book, those who believe in Allah, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them; bowing in humility to Allah: They will not sell the Signs of Allah for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord, and Allah is swift in account. [3:199]
O ye who believe! Persevere in patience and constancy; vie in such perseverance; strengthen each other; and fear Allah. that ye may prosper [3:200]
