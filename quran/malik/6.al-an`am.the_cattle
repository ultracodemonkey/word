All praise be to Allah, the One Who has created the heavens and the earth and made  the darkness and the light; yet the unbelievers set up equal partners with their  Lord.[1]
He is the One Who has created you from clay, then decreed a fixed term of  life and set a deadline for you Himself; yet you go on doubting![2]
He is the same  One Allah in both the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal, what you  reveal and what you do.[3]
Yet the reaction of the people has been that whenever a  revelation came to them from their Lord, they neglected it.[4]
Now that the truth has  come to them, they have denied it. Soon they will come to know the reality which  they are ridiculing.[5]
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed  before them? We had made those nations more powerful in the land than yourselves.  We sent down for them abundant rain from the sky and made the rivers to flow  beneath their feet: yet for their sins We destroyed them all and raised up other  generations in their places.[6]
O Prophet, if We had sent to you a Book written on paper and they could have  touched it with their own hands, the unbelievers would still have said: "This is nothing  but plain sorcery!"[7]
They ask: "Why has no angel been sent down to us?" Well, if  We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been settled at once and no  respite would have been granted after that;[8]
and if We had sent an angel, We  would have certainly sent him in a human form and thus involved them in the same  confusion as they are in at this time.[9]
O Muhammad! many Messengers before you  were also ridiculed, but in the long run those who ridiculed were hemmed in by the  very thing they were ridiculing.[10]
O Muhammad, say: "Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those  who denied the truth."[11]
Ask them: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and  in the earth?" If they don't respond, tell them: "To Allah!" He has decreed mercy for  Himself, that is why He does not punish you for your misdeeds right away. He will  certainly gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection; there is no doubt about  it. Yet those who have lost their souls will not believe.[12]
To Him belongs all that  takes rest in the night and in the day. He is the Hearer, the Knower.[13]
Say: "Should  I take as my protector anyone other than Allah, who is the Creator of the heavens  and the earth. Who feeds all and is fed by none?" Say: "Nay! I am commanded to be  the first of those who submit to Allah in Islam and not of those who commit shirk."[14]
Say: "I will never disobey my Lord, for I fear the torment of a Mighty Day."[15]
He  who is delivered from the torment of that Day, has indeed received Allah’s Mercy;  and this is a clear cut achievement.[16]
If Allah afflicts you with any harm, none can  relieve you other than Him; and if He blesses you with happiness, you should know  that He has power over everything.[17]
He is the Supreme Authority over His  servants; and He is the Wise, the Aware.[18]
Ask them: " Whose testimony is the most reliable? " When they say Allah, then tell  them: "Let Allah be Witness between me and you (that I am the Messenger of Allah)  and this Qur’an has been revealed to me by Him so that I may warn you thereby and  all those whom it may reach. Can you really testify that there are other gods besides  Allah?" Tell them: "As far as I am concerned I will never testify to this!" Say: "Indeed  He is the One and the Only God and I am absolutely disgusted with the shirk you  commit.[19]
Those to whom We have given the Book know this fact as they know  their own sons. In fact those who have lost their souls, will not believe.[20]
Who can be more wicked than a person who forges a lie against Allah or denies His  revelations? Surely the wrongdoers shall never get salvation.[21]
On the Day of  Judgment when We shall gather them all together, We shall ask the pagans: "Where  are those deities whom you ascribed to be My partners?"[22]
They will have no  argument but to say: "By Allah, our Lord, we were not at all pagan."[23]
See how  they will lie against their own souls, and how the deities of their own inventions will  leave them in the lurch.[24]
Of them there are some who pretend that they listen to  you; but their prejudices have dulled their faculties and We have cast veils over their  hearts and deafness in their ears so they are unable to understand. Even if they see  every one of Our Signs, they will not believe. So much so, that when they come to  you, they argue with you. The unbelievers say: "These are nothing but tales of the old  times."[25]
They themselves have turned away from the truth and also forbid other  people to believe in it. With such a behavior they harm none but their own souls but  they do not perceive it.[26]
If you could witness the scene, when they will be made to stand before the hellfire,  they will say: "We wish we could return to earthly life again; then we would not deny  the revelations of our Lord, and we would join the believers!"[27]
In fact, they will say  this because they had come to know the reality which they were concealing before.  As a matter of fact even if they be sent back, they would certainly repeat the same  things which they had been forbidden to do. Indeed they are liars.[28]
Today they  say: "There is no other life except the life on this earth and we shall never be raised  to life again."[29]
If you could witness the scene when they will be brought before  their Lord; He will ask, "Is this not a reality?" They will say: "Yes, our Lord, this is the  reality." He will order: "Well, then taste the punishment for denying this reality."[30]
Those people are indeed lost who deny that they will ever meet Allah. When the hour  of Doomsday will overtake them all of a sudden, they will exclaim: "Alas! How  negligent we have been about this Hour." They will be carrying the burden of their  sins on their backs; and evil indeed are the burdens that they carry![31]
The life of  this world is nothing but play and amusement, but the life of the Hereafter will be  better for those who are righteous. Will you not use your common sense?[32]
O  Muhammad We know it well that what they say grieves you: it is not you that they  deny, these wrongdoers actually deny the revelations of Allah.[33]
Many Messengers  before you were denied but patiently bore with their denial and persecution until Our  help came down to them: for none can change the decrees of Allah. You have  already received the news of what happened to those Messengers.[34]
If you find  their aversion hard to bear, then see if you can make a tunnel in the ground or put a  ladder to ascend in the skies by which you can bring them a sign. O Prophet, you  know well that if Allah wanted, He would have given guidance to all. So do not be like  the ignorant.[35]
Surely those who listen accept the Truth. As for the dead (those with closed minds),  Allah will bring them back to life, on the Day of Judgment, to be produced in His  court.[36]
They ask: "Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?" Tell  them: "Allah is surely able to send down a Sign; but most of them do not understand  the wisdom behind it."[37]
If you really want to see the signs of Allah, just look at any  animal that walks upon the earth and any bird that flies in the air; they too are the  communities like you. We have not left out anything from the Book in determining the  courses of their lives. They all shall be gathered before their Lord.[38]
Those who  deny Our Revelations are deaf and dumb, living in many layers of darkness. Allah  confounds whom He will, and guides to the Right Way whom He pleases.[39]
Ask  them to think carefully and answer: "When you face a disaster or the last Hour  approaches you, do you call for help anyone other than Allah? Answer me if you are  truthful!"[40]
No, on Him Alone you will call, and forget those whom you have set up  as His partners; then if He pleases, He relieves you from the affliction about which  you have prayed to Him.[41]
We did send Messengers before you to other nations and afflicted them with  suffering and adversities so that they might learn humility.[42]
Why did they not  humble themselves when the sufferings overtook them? On the contrary their hearts  became hardened and Satan made their sinful acts seem fair to them.[43]
When they  neglected the warning they had received, then, instead of punishment, We opened  the gates of every kind of prosperity for them; but just as they were rejoicing in what  they were given, We suddenly seized them; lo! They were plunged into despair![44]
Thus We cut off the roots of the wrongdoers. All praises are due to Allah the Lord of  the worlds.[45]
Ask them: "Just think, if Allah takes away your hearing and your sight and seals up  your hearts, is there any deity other than Allah who could restore them to you?" See  how We present Our revelations over and over again and yet they turn away.[46]
Say: "Just think if the punishment of Allah comes to you whether suddenly or openly,  would any be destroyed other than the wrongdoers?"[47]
We have sent the  Messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend  their ways shall have nothing to fear or to regret.[48]
But those who deny Our  Revelations shall be punished for their transgression.[49]
Say: "I do not claim that I  possess the treasures of Allah, or that I know the unseen nor do I claim that I am an  angel. What I say is that I follow only that which is revealed to me." Ask them: "Are  the blind and the seeing alike? Why don’t you think?"[50]
O Muhammad, admonish with this (The Qur'an), those who have the fear of being  assembled before their Lord in such a condition that there will be no one to protect  them or intercede on their behalf other than Him. It may be that, by this admonition,  they may become righteous.[51]
Do not drive away those (poor people like Bilal,  Ammar and Suhaib) who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking only to gain  His favor. You are in no way accountable for their deeds nor they are in any way  accountable for yours. So if you drive them away, you shall be counted among the  wrongdoers.[52]
That’s how We have made some of them (poor and slaves who  accepted Islam) a means for testing the others (the chiefs of Qureysh), so that they  should say: "Are these the people whom Allah favors among us (the poor, indigent  and low class)?" Well, does Allah not know best those who are grateful?[53]
When  those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say: "Peace be upon you. Your  Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself. If anyone among you commits evil because of  ignorance and thereafter repents and mends his ways; you will find Allah Forgiving,  Merciful."[54]
Thus, We spell out Our revelations, so that the way of the culprits may  become evident.[55]
O Muhammad, tell them: "I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon  besides Allah." Say: "I am not going to follow your wishes: if I do, I would be lost and  cease to be from the rightly guided."[56]
Say: "I am on a clear proof from my Lord  which you have denied, but the scourge of Allah, which you are in such a rush to see,  is not in my power. No one has the authority of passing Judgment except Allah: He  declares the truth and He is the best of Judges."[57]
Say: "If what you rush to see  was in my power, the matter between you and me would have been settled long ago;  but Allah knows best how to deal with wrongdoers.[58]
He Alone has the keys of the  unseen treasures, of which no one knows except Him. He knows whatever is in the  land and in the sea; there is not a single leaf that falls without His knowledge, there is  neither a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry which has not  been recorded in a Clear Book.[59]
He is the One Who takes your souls at night  (makes you go to sleep) and knows what you do during the day, then next day raises  you up again to complete your allotted span of life. To Him you shall all return, then  He will notify you of all that you have done."[60]
He is the Irresistible (reigns supreme) over his servants and sends guardian angels  over you. At length, when death approaches anyone of you, Our angels take his soul  and they are not negligent in performing their duty.[61]
Then those souls are brought  back to Allah, their real Master. Beware! He is the Judge and He is the swiftest in  settling accounts.[62]
Ask them: "Who delivers you from calamities in the darkness of the land and of the  sea, when you call upon Him in open humility and silent terror: If You deliver us from  this affliction, we shall become truly grateful."[63]
Say: "Allah delivers you from these  and all other calamities, yet you commit shirk (worship false gods)!"[64]
Say: "He has  the power to send calamities on you from above and from below or to split you into  discordant factions to make you taste the violence of one another. See how We  present Our revelations over and over again so that they may understand the  reality.[65]
But your people are rejecting this (The Qur'an), although it is the very  truth." Tell them: "I am not appointed as your caretaker.[66]
For every prophecy there  is an appointed time, and soon you will come to know."[67]
When you see those who are engaged in arguments about Our revelations, turn  away from them until they change their topic of discussion. If Satan ever makes you  forget this commandment, then as soon as you realize, withdraw from the company  of wrongdoers.[68]
Though righteous people will not be held responsible for  wrongdoers' actions, yet it is their duty to admonish them; perhaps they may refrain  from evil deeds.[69]
Leave those people alone, who take their religion as mere play and amusement and  are deceived by the life of this world. However, keep on admonishing them with this  (The Qur'an), lest their souls be damned by their own sinful deeds. They will not have  any protector or intercessor to rescue them from Allah, and if they seek to offer every  imaginable ransom, it shall not be accepted from them. Such are those who are  damned by their own sinful deeds. They will get boiling water to drink and painful  torture for their rejection of the Truth.[70]
Ask the pagans: "Should we call on those, instead of Allah, who can neither benefit  us nor harm us? Should we turn upon our heels after Allah has guided us to the Right  Way? Like the one whom Satan has misled and is wandering around in the land,  while his friends are calling him to the right way, shouting: "Come this way!" Tell  them: "Allah’s guidance is the only guidance. We are commanded to surrender  (become Muslims) to the Lord of the worlds,[71]
to establish Salah and fear Him,  before Whom you shall all be assembled on the Day of Judgment.[72]
He is the One  Who has created the heavens and the earth to manifest the Truth. On the Day when  He will say: "Be," it shall be (the Day of Resurrection). His Word is the truth. He shall  be the sole Sovereign on the Day when the trumpet will be blown. He has the full  knowledge of the invisible and the visible. He is the Wise, the Aware.[73]
Tell them about Abraham, who said to Azer, his father: "Are you taking idols for  gods? Surely, I see you and your people in manifest error."[74]
We showed Abraham  the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , as We show you with examples from  nature, so he became one of the firm believers.[75]
When the night drew its shadow  over him, he saw a star and said, "this is my Lord." But when it set, he said: "I do not  love to worship such a god that fades away."[76]
Afterwards he saw the moon  shining, he said; "This is my Lord." But when it also set, he cried: "If my Lord does  not guide me, I shall certainly become one of those who go astray."[77]
Then when  he saw the sun with its brighter shine, and he said: "This must be my Lord; it is larger  than the other two." But when it also set, he exclaimed: "O my people! I am done with  your shirk (associating partners with Allah).[78]
As far as I am concerned, I will turn  my face, being upright, to Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, and I am  not one of the pagans."[79]
When his people started arguing with him, he told them: "Will you argue with me  about Allah, whereas He Himself has guided me? I do not fear those whom you take  for gods besides Him, none can harm me unless my Lord so wills, the knowledge of  my Lord encompasses everything, why don’t you get admonition?[80]
Why should I  fear your idols, when you are not afraid of your actions of making them partners with  Allah, for which He has not given you any sanction? Which one from the two parties  of us deserves to feel secure? Tell me, if you know the truth.[81]
As a matter of fact  those who believe and do not taint their faith with wrongdoings will feel more secure  and will be better guided."[82]
This was the argument which We furnished Abraham against his people. We exalt in  ranks whom We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Aware.[83]
We gave him Isaac  and Jacob and guided them all as We guided Noah before them, and among his  descendants were David (David), Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses and Haroon  (Aaron); thus do We reward those who do good to others.[84]
Other descendants  include Zakariya, John, Jesus, and Ilyas (Elias); all of them were righteous;[85]
and  Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot. We exalted every one of them over the worlds[86]
as  We exalted some of their forefathers, their children and their brothers. We chose  them for Our service and guided them to the Right Way.[87]
This is the guidance  from Allah; He bestows it upon whom He pleases of His devotees. If they had  committed shirk (worshiped anyone else besides Allah) all their deeds would have  become void.[88]
Such were the people to whom We gave the Book, wisdom and  Prophethood. Now if these people deny this guidance, it does not matter; We would  bestow this guidance upon other people who would not disbelieve.[90]
O  Muhammad, those were the people who were rightly guided by Allah, therefore,  follow their guidance and tell these people: "I am not asking you any compensation  for this work of delivering the Message to you, this message is nothing but a  reminder to all the worlds."[91]
Those people have not valued the attributes of Allah, the way His attributes should  be valued, who say: "Allah has never revealed anything to a human being." Ask  them: "Who then sent down the Book (Torah) which Moses brought, a light and  guidance for mankind? You have transcribed it on separate sheets, publishing some  and suppressing much of that given knowledge, which neither you nor your  forefathers previously possessed." If they do not answer, then just say: "Allah" and  leave them alone with the discourse of their useless arguments.[91]
This is the blessed Book, like the one given to Moses, which We have revealed,  confirming what came before it, that you, O Muhammad, may warn the people living  in the Mother City (Mecca) and those who live around her. Those who believe in the  hereafter, will believe in this (Book) and will be steadfast in taking care of their Salah  (prescribed prayers).[92]
Who can be more wicked than the one who invents a lie  against Allah, or says: "This was revealed to me," while nothing was revealed to him?  Or the one who says: "I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed?" If you could  only see these wrongdoers when they are in the agonies of death and the angels  stretch forth their hands saying, "Take out your soul! Today you will be rewarded with  a disgraceful punishment for saying falsehood against Allah which you had no right to  say and showing arrogance against His revelations!"[93]
Allah adds to what the  angels said, "So you have come back to Us Alone as We created you at the first  time, leaving behind all that which We gave you in that world and We don’t see with  you your intercessors, whom you claimed to be Allah’s partners in your affairs; all  your ties have been cut off and what you presumed has failed you."[94]
Surely it is Allah Who causes the seed and the fruit-stone to split and sprout. He  brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. It is Allah, Who  does all this; then why are you being misled?[95]
He causes the daybreak from the  dark. He makes the night for rest and makes the rising and setting of the sun and the  moon for you to determine times ( days, weeks, months and years), these are the  arrangements of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.[96]
He is the One Who has made the  stars for you, so that you might find your way thereby in the darkness whether you  are on the land or the sea. We have spelled out Our revelations very clearly for  people of common sense.[97]
He is the One Who has created you from a single soul  and granted you dwelling on Earth and a resting place in the hereafter. We have  spelled out Our revelation very clearly for people of understanding.[98]
It is He Who  sends down rainwater from the sky and therewith produces vegetation of all kinds:  He brings forth green crops producing grain piled up in the ear, palm-trees laden with  clusters of dates hanging within reach, gardens of grapes, olives, and pomegranates;  though their fruit resembles in kind yet is different in variety. Look at their fruits as  they yield and ripen. Behold! In these things there are signs for true believers.[99]
Yet they make the Jinns (Genies: creature which has been created out of fire) as the  partners with Allah, whereas He is their Creator; and also ascribe to Him sons and  daughters without having any knowledge. Glory to Him! He is highly exalted far  above what they ascribe.[100]
He is the creator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He  has no consort? He has created everything and is aware of everything.[101]
That is  Allah your Lord! There is no god but Him, the creator of everything. Therefore,  worship Him, He is the Guardian of everything.[102]
No vision can grasp Him while  He grasps all visions. He is the Subtle, the Aware.[103]
Now there have come to you  clear proofs from your Lord to open your eyes. Therefore, anyone who will open his  eyes, it is good for his own soul and anyone who will play blind, it is to his own harm,  and I am the Prophet, not assigned as a keeper over you.[104]
Thus do We explain  Our revelations over and over again so that the unbelievers may say: "You have  learned from someone, but not from Allah" and that this may become clear to people  of understanding.[105]
Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, there is no god  but Him and turn aside from the pagans.[106]
If Allah wanted they would not be  pagans. We have neither appointed you their keeper nor made you their  guardian.[107]
O believers, do not insult those, whom these pagans call upon besides Allah, lest in  retaliation they call bad names to Allah out of their ignorance. Thus We have made  the deeds of every group of people seem fair to them. In the end they will all return to  their Lord and then, He will inform them of the reality of all that they have done.[108]
These pagans solemnly swear by Allah that if a Sign came to them they would most  certainly believe in your Prophethood. Say: "All signs are vouchsafed by Allah." What  should make you understand that if a sign comes to them they will still not  believe?[109]
We will turn away their hearts and their eyes from the Truth because of  their attitude which prompted them to disbelieve in the first place, and We will leave  them to wander in their rebellious wrongdoing.[110]
Even if We had sent to them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and  presented all the different things of the world before them as proof, they would have  not believed, unless Allah wanted otherwise (and forcing someone to believe is not  what He wants): Yet most of them act out of ignorance.[111]
Like this Messenger,  We had granted each Messenger his opponents - Satans from among the human  beings and Jinns - some of them inspire the others with seductive discourses of  deception. If your Lord wanted, they would not have done so. Therefore, neglect  them as well as what they invent,[112]
so that the hearts of those who do not believe  in the hereafter may be inclined to what they say, and be pleased with it; and so that  they can earn what they wish to earn.[113]
Say: Should I seek a judge other than  Allah, when He is the One Who has revealed this Book (The Qur'an) with full details?  Those whom We gave the Book, before you, know very well that it is revealed to you  from your Lord with the Truth; therefore, you should not be of those who have  doubts.[114]
The Words of your Lord have been completed with credibility and  justice; there is no way to change His Words. He is the Hearer, the Knower.[115]
If you obey (other than the Messenger, then you should know that) most of the  people on earth will lead you away from the Way of Allah, for they follow nothing but  guesswork and preach nothing but falsehood.[116]
In fact, your Lord knows best  those people who have strayed from His Way and He knows best those who are on  the Right Way.[117]
So eat of that meat on which Allah’s name has been  pronounced if you truly believe in His revelations.[118]
Why should you not eat that  on which Allah’s name has been pronounced, when He has clearly spelled out for  you in detail what is forbidden - except in a case of extreme helplessness? In fact,  many do mislead people by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Your Lord  knows best those who transgress.[119]
Eschew all sin whether open or secret: surely  those who earn sin will get due punishment for their wrongdoings.[120]
Do not eat of  that meat on which Allah’s name has not been pronounced, since that is most surely  a transgression. In fact the Satans inspire their friends that they should argue with  you, and if you obey them, most surely you will be considered a pagan.[121]
Can a person who was dead (ignorant), and whom We raised to life and gave the  Light to walk with among people, be like the one who is in the depths of darkness  from which he can never come out? Since they treat both of them alike, the actions of  the unbelievers are made lucrative to them,[122]
and that is why in every town We  have placed the criminals as their ring leaders to plot therein, they plot against none  but their own souls, though they do not perceive it.[123]
Whenever there comes to  them a sign (verses of The Qur'an) they say: "We shall not believe until we are given  directly that which is given to the Messengers of Allah." Allah knows best to whom He  should give His Message. Soon these criminals will be overtaken by humiliation and  by a severe punishment from Allah for their evil plots.[124]
Whomever Allah wills to guide, He opens his chest to Islam and whomever He  intends to confound, He makes his chest narrow and squeezes so tight that, at the  very idea of Islam, he feels as if his soul is going to climb up towards the sky. That is  how Allah places a blight on those who do not believe,[125]
whereas in fact this way  (Al-Islam) is the Right Way of your Lord and We have spelled out Our revelations  very clearly for the people who use their common sense.[126]
For them there will be  a home of peace with their Lord. He will be their protector because of their good  deeds.[127]
On the Day when He will assemble them all together, (Allah will address the Jinns):  "O assembly of Jinns! You seduced mankind in great number." And their votaries  from among mankind will say: "Our Lord, we have both enjoyed each other's  fellowship but alas! Now we have reached the end of our term which You had  decreed for us." Then Allah will say: "Now hellfire is your dwelling-place; you will live  therein forever unless Allah ordains otherwise." Surely your Lord is Wise,  Knowledgeable.[129]
That is how, in the hereafter, We will make wrongdoers the  comrades of one another on account of what they earned during their life on Earth  with evil friendship.[129]
At that time Allah will also ask: "O Assembly of Jinns and mankind! Did not there  come to you the Messengers from amongst you who proclaimed to you My  revelations and warned you about the meeting of this Day?" They will reply: "Yes  they did, We bear witness against our own souls." Today this worldly life has  deceived them but on that Day they will testify against themselves that they were  indeed kuffar (unbelievers).[130]
Your Lord would not destroy towns without just  cause while their residents were ignorant of the Reality.[131]
All will be awarded  ranks according to their deeds, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.[132]
Your Lord is Self-Sufficient, Lord of Mercy. If He wants, He can destroy you all and  replace you with others as He pleases, just as He raised you from the offspring of  other people.[133]
Surely what you are being threatened with, must come to pass  and you can do nothing about it.[134]
O Muhammad, tell them: "O my people! If you  don’t listen to me, do whatever you want and I’ll do whatever I deem right; you will  soon find out who is to gain the reward of the hereafter; rest assured that the  wrongdoers will not get salvation." [135]
They set aside a share of their produce and of their cattle for Allah, saying: "This is  for Allah" - so they pretend - "and this for our shoraka' (their assigned partners of  Allah)." Their shoraka's share does not reach Allah, but the share of Allah is wholly  given to shoraka'. What an evil decision they make![136]
Their shoraka' have  induced many pagans to kill their own children in order to ruin them and confuse  them in their religion. If Allah wanted, they would not have done so. Therefore, leave  them alone with their false inventions.[137]
These pagans say that such and such  cattle and crops are reserved, in the name of such and such temple, and no one  should eat except those whom we permit - in fact these restrictions they themselves  have imposed. Then there are some animals which they have prohibited from riding  or carrying loads, and there are still other animals over which they do not pronounce  the name of Allah. They have falsely attributed all these things to Him. Soon He will  requite them for their invented lies.[138]
They also say: "The offspring of these cattle  is specially reserved for our males and forbidden to our females but if it is stillborn  then all can share together." Soon He will punish them for their attribution of such  superstitions to Allah. Surely He is Wise, Knowledgeable.[139]
Actual losers are  those who kill their own children foolishly without knowledge and forbid food which  Allah has provided them, falsely ascribing prohibitions to Allah. Certainly they have  gone astray and are not at all rightly guided.[140]
It is He who has created all kinds of plants, trellised and untrellised, the palm trees,  the field crops with produce of different kinds, the olives and pomegranates, similar in  kind yet different in taste. Eat of their fruit in their season and give away their Zakah  on the harvest day. Do not be spendthrift, surely He does not love the  spendthrifts.[141]
Of the animals you have, some are for transportation and some for  slaughter. Eat of that which Allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps  of Satan; surely he is your open enemy.[142]
For eight heads of cattle, male and female, there are superstitions. Take a pair of  sheep and a pair of goats, for example, and ask them, "Of these, has He forbidden  you the males, females or their fetuses? Answer me based on knowledge, not  superstition, if what you say is true."[143]
Likewise ask them about a pair of camels  and a pair of cows, "Of these, has He forbidden you the males, females or their  fetuses?" If they answer, then ask them: "Were you present when Allah gave you  these commandments?" If not then Who can be more unjust than the one who forges  a lie against Allah, so that he may mislead mankind without having any knowledge?  Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.[144]
O Muhammad tell them: I did not find in what has been revealed to me anything  forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, except the meat of an already  dead animal, or running blood or the flesh of swine (pork) - for these are unclean - or  flesh of an animal which has become profane because of slaughtering in the names  other than Allah. Even so, if anyone is forced in a helpless situation, intending neither  disobedience nor transgression, you will find your Lord Forgiving, Merciful.[145]
For  those who are Jews, We forbade every animal with undivided hoofs and the fat of  oxen and sheep except what is attached to their backs or their intestines or is mixed  with their bones. This was the punishment We had inflicted for their wilful  disobedience. What We said is true.[146]
Now if they disbelieve you, say: "Your Lord  is the owner of boundless Mercy; but His scourge cannot be averted from criminal  people.[147]
In response to this the pagans will promptly say: "If Allah wanted, neither we nor our  forefathers would have been pagans, or we could have made anything unlawful."  That is how their ancestors rejected the truth in the past until they tasted of Our  punishment. If they say so, then ask them: "Do you have any evidence that you can  put before us? The fact of the matter is, you believe in nothing but conjecture and  follow nothing but falsehood."[148]
Say: "In contrast to your position, Allah’s  argument is conclusive; if it had been His will He could indeed have guided you  all."[149]
Say: "Bring your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so and so." Even if  they so testify, do not testify with them, nor yield to the wishes of those who deny Our  revelations, disbelieve in the hereafter, and set up others as equals with their  Lord.[150]
O Muhammad, say: "Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you: not to  commit shirk with Him, to be kind to your parents, not to kill your children making the  excuse of inability to support them - We provide sustenance for you and for them not  to commit shameful deeds whether open or secret, not to kill any soul forbidden  by Allah except for the requirements of justice. These are the things which He  enjoined you so that you may learn wisdom.[151]
Furthermore, not to go near the  property of an orphan except in the best way (to improve it), until he attains maturity.  Give full measure and just weight - We never charge a soul with more than it can  bear. Whenever you speak, be just, even if it affects your own relatives, and fulfill  your covenant with Allah. These are the things which He has enjoined on you so that  you may be mindful.[152]
He has also said: Verily this is My way, the Right Way;  therefore follow it and do not follow other ways, for they will lead you away from Him.  This is what He enjoined on you so that you may guard yourselves against evil.[153]
Moreover, He said, We gave Moses the Book to complete Our favor on those who  would do good to others; it contained details of all things, and was a guide and a  mercy, so that they should believe in the ultimate meeting with their Lord."[154]
We have revealed this Book, similar to the Book given to Moses, as a blessing;  therefore, follow it and adopt a Godfearing attitude so that you may receive  mercy.[155]
Lest you say: "The Book was revealed only to two parties before us and  we were unaware of what they read,"[156]
or lest you say: "If the Book had been  revealed to us, we could have followed its guidance better than them," a veritable  sign has now come to you from your Lord as a guidance and mercy. Who then is  more unjust than the one who denies the revelations of Allah and turns away from  them? Very soon those who turn away from Our revelations will face dreadful  punishment for their aversion.[157]
Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to  come down to them or are they waiting to be given a certain sign of your Lord! On the  Day when that certain sign of your Lord appears, the belief will not profit that soul  which did not believe before, or who, while professing to believe did not do good  deeds. Say to them: "Wait if you will; we too are waiting."[158]
Surely those who divide the religion into sects and identify themselves as a sect, O  Muhammad, you have nothing to do with them. Their case will be called to account  by Allah Himself, He will inform them as to what they did.[159]
Whoever does one  good deed, he will be given credit for ten similar good deeds, and whoever does one  bad deed will be punished for only one, and no one will be treated unjustly.[160]
O Muhammad, tell them: "As for me, surely my Lord has guided me to the Right Way,  the ever true Deen, the faith of Abraham the upright and he was not of the  pagans."[161]
Also declare: "Surely my Salah, my devotion, my life, and my death  are all for Allah the Lord of the Worlds.[162]
He has no peer; thus am I commanded  and I am the first of the Muslims."[163]
Say: "Should I seek another Lord besides  Allah when He is the Lord of everything?" Every soul will reap the fruits of its own  deeds; no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Ultimately you will  return to your Lord, and He will resolve for you your disputes.[164]
He is the One  Who has made you the inheritors of the earth and raised some of you in ranks over  others so that He may test you in what He has given you. Surely your Lord is swift in  retribution; yet He is also very Forgiving, Merciful."[165]
