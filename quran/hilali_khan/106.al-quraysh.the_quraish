(It is a great Grace and Protection from Allah), for the taming of the Quraish,
(And with all those Allahs Grace and Protections for their taming, We cause) the (Quraish) caravans to set forth safe in winter (to the south), and in summer (to the north without any fear),
So let them worship (Allah) the Lord of this House (the Kabah in Makkah).
(He) Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.
