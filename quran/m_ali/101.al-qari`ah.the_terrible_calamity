The calamity!
What is the calamity?
And what will make thee know how terrible is the calamity?
The day wherein men will be as scattered moths,
And the mountains will be as carded wool.
Then as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy,
He will live a pleasant life.
And as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is light,
The abyss is a mother to him.
And what will make thee know what that is?
A burning Fire.
