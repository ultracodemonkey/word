In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds,
The Beneficent, the Merciful,
Master of the day of Requital.
Thee do we serve and Thee do we beseech for help.
Guide us on the right path,
The path of those upon whom Thou has bestowed favours, Not those upon whom wrath is brought down, nor those who go astray.
