Has there come to thee the news of the Overwhelming Event?
Faces on that day will be downcast,
Labouring, toiling,
Entering burning Fire,
Made to drink from a boiling spring.
They will have no food but of thorns,
Neither nourishing nor satisfying hunger.
Faces on that day will be happy,
Glad for their striving,
In a lofty Garden,
Wherein thou wilt hear no vain talk.
Therein is a fountain flowing.
Therein are thrones raised high,
And drinking-cups ready placed,
And cushions set in tows,
And carpets spread out.
See they not the clouds, how they are created?
And the heaven, how it is raised high?
And the mountains, how they are fixed?
And the earth, how it is spread out?
So remind. Thou art only one to remind.
Thou art not warder over them --
But whoever turns back and disbelieves,
Allah will chastise him with the greatest chastisement.
Surely to Us is their return,
Then it is for Us to call them to account.
