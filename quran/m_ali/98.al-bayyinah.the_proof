Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the idolaters could not have been freed till clear evidence came to them --
A Messenger from Allah, reciting pure pages,
Wherein are (all) right books.
Nor did those to whom the Book was given become divided till clear evidence came to them.
And they are enjoined naught but to serve Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience, upright, and to keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and that is the right religion.
Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the idolaters will be in the Fire of hell, abiding therein. They are the worst of creatures.
Those who believe and do good, they are the best of creatures.
Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of perpetuity wherein flow rivers, abiding therein for ever. Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord.
