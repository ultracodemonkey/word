By the brightness of the day!
And the night when it is still! --
Thy Lord has not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased.
And surely the latter state is better for thee than the former.
And soon will thy Lord give thee so that thou wilt be well pleased.
Did He not find thee an orphan and give (thee) shelter?
And find thee groping, so He showed the way?
And find thee in want, so He enriched thee?
Therefore the orphan, oppress not.
And him who asks, chide not.
And the favour of thy Lord proclaim.
