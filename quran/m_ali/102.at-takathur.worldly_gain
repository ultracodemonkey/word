Abundance diverts you,
Until you come to the graves.
Nay, you will soon know,
Nay, again, you will soon know.
Nay, would that you knew with a certain knowledge!
You will certainly see hell;
Then you will see it with certainty of sight;
Then on that day you shall certainly be questioned about the boons.
