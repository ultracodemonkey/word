By the fig and the olive!
And mount Sinai!
And this City made secure! --
Certainly We created man in the best make.
Then We render him the lowest of the low,
Except those who believe and do good; so theirs is a reward never to be cut off.
So who can give the lie to thee after (this) about the Judgment?
Is not Allah the Best of the Judges?
