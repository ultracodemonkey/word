By those running and uttering cries!
And those producing fire, striking!
And those suddenly attacking at morn!
Then thereby they raise dust,
Then penetrate thereby gatherings --
Surely man is ungrateful to his Lord.
And surely he is a witness of that.
And truly on account of the love of wealth he is niggardly.
Knows he not when that which is in the graves is raised,
And that which is in the breasts is made manifest?
Surely their Lord this day is Aware of them.
