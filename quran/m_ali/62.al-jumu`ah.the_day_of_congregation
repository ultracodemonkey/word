Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah, the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise.
He it is Who raised among the illiterates a Messenger from among themselves, who recites to them His messages and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and the Wisdom -- though they were before certainly in manifest error --
And others from among them who have not yet joined them. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.
That is Allah’s grace; He grants it to whom He pleases. And Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
The likeness of those who were charged with the Torah, then they observed it not, is as the likeness of the ass carrying books. Evil is the likeness of the people who reject the messages of Allah. And Allah guides not the iniquitous people.
Say: O you who are Jews, if you think that you are the favourites of Allah to the exclusion of other people, then invoke death, if you are truthful.
But they will never invoke it because of what their hands have sent before. And Allah is Knower of the wrongdoers.
Say: The death from which you flee, that will surely overtake you; then you will be sent back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, so He will inform you of that which you did.
O you who believe when the call is sounded for prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave off traffic. That is better for you, if you know.
But when the prayer is ended, disperse abroad in the land and seek of Allah’s grace, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful.
And when they see merchandise or sport, they break away to it, and leave thee standing. Say: What is with Allah is better than sport and merchandise. And Allah is the Best of Providers.
