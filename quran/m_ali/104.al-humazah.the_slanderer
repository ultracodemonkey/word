Woe to every slanderer, defamer!
Who amasses wealth and counts it --
He thinks that his wealth will make him abide.
Nay, he will certainly be hurled into the crushing disaster;
And what will make thee realize what the crushing disaster is?
It is the Fire kindled by Allah,
Which rises over the hearts.
Surely it is closed in on them,
In extended columns.
