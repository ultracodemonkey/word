When the earth is shaken with her shaking,
And the earth brings forth her burdens,
And man says: What has befallen her?
On that day she will tell her news,
As if thy Lord had revealed to her.
On that day men will come forth in sundry bodies that they may be shown their works.
So he who does an atom’s weight of good will see it.
And he who does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.
