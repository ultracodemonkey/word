By the fig and the olive.
Mount Sinai.
And this honored town (Mecca).
We created man in the best design.
Then turned him into the lowliest of the lowly.
Except those who believe and lead a righteous life; they receive a reward that is well deserved.
Why do you still reject the faith?
Is GOD not the Most Wise, of all the wise ones?
