By the forenoon.
By the night as it falls.
Your Lord never abandoned you, nor did He forget.
The Hereafter is far better for you than this first (life).
And your Lord will give you enough; you will be pleased.
Did He not find you orphaned and He gave you a home?
He found you astray, and guided you.
He found you poor, and made you rich.
Therefore, you shall not forsake the orphan.
Nor shall you reprimand the beggar.
You shall proclaim the blessing your Lord has bestowed upon you.
