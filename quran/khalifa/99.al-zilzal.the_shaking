When the earth is severely quaked.
And the earth ejects its loads.
The human will wonder: "What is happening?"
On that day, it will tell its news.
That your Lord has commanded it.
On that day, the people will issue from every direction, to be shown their works.
Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it.
And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.
