The Shocker.
What a shocker!
KHALIFA:Do you have any idea what the Shocker is?
That is the day when the people come out like swarms of butterflies.
The mountains will be like fluffy wool.
As for him whose weights are heavy.
He will lead a happy (eternal) life.
As for him whose weights are light.
His destiny is lowly.
Do you know what it is?
The blazing Hellfire.
