By the fast gallopers.
Igniting sparks.
Invading (the enemy) by morning.
Striking terror therein.
Penetrating to the heart of their territory.
The human being is unappreciative of his Lord.
He bears witness to this fact.
He loves material things excessively.
Does he not realize that the day will come when the graves are opened?
And all secrets are brought out.
They will find out, on that day, that their Lord has been fully Cognizant of them.
