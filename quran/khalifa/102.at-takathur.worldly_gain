You remain preoccupied with hoarding.
Until you go to the graves.
Indeed, you will find out.
Most assuredly, you will find out.
If only you could find out for certain.
You would envision Hell.
Then you would see it with the eye of certainty.
Then you will be questioned, on that day, about the blessings you had enjoyed.
