O people, be aware of your Lord who has created you from one soul and He created from it its mate and sent forth from it many men and women; and be aware of God whom you ask about, and the relatives. God is watcher over you.
And give the orphans their money, and do not replace the good with the bad, and do not consume their money to your money; for truly it is a great sin!
And if you fear that you cannot be just to the orphans, then marry those whom you see fit from their mothers, two, and three, and four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then only one, or whom you are already betrothed to. This is best that you do not face financial hardship.
And give the women their property willingly, and if they remit any of it to you of their own will, then you may take it with good feelings.
And do not give the immature ones their money that God has entrusted to you, and spend on them from it and clothe them, and speak to them in goodness.
And test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage, then if you determine in them sound judgment, then give them their wealth, and do not deliberately consume it wastefully or quickly before they grow up. And whoever is rich, then let him not claim anything, and if he is poor then let him consume only in goodness. If you give to them their wealth, then make a witness for them, and God is enough for Reckoning.
For the men is a portion from what the parents and the relatives left behind, and for the women is a portion from what the parents and relatives left behind, be it little or much; a forced portion.
And if the distribution is attended by the relatives and the orphans and the needy, then you shall give them part of it and say to them a kind saying.
And what if it was them who had left behind them a weak progeny, would they not be concerned for them? Let them revere God and let them say what is appropriate.
Those who consume the money of the orphans illicitly, in fact they are consuming fire in their bellies, and they will endure the Blaze.
God directs you regarding the inheritance of your children: "To the male shall be as that given to two females. If they are only females and more than two, then they will have two thirds of what is inherited. And if there is only one female, then she will have one half, and to his parents each one of them one sixth of what is inherited if he has children. If he has no children and his parents are the heirs, then to his mother is one third; if he has siblings then to his mother is one sixth. All after a will is carried through or a debt. Your parents and your children, you do not know which is closer to you in benefit, a directive from God, God is Knowledgeable, Wise."
And for you is half of what your wives leave behind if they have no children; but if they have a child then to you is one quarter of what they leave behind. All after a will is carried through or a debt. And to them is one quarter of what you leave behind if you have no child; but if you have a child then to them is one eighth of what you leave behind. All after a will is carried through or a debt. And if a man or a woman has no one, but has a brother or sister, then to each one of them is one sixth, but if they are more than this then they are to share in one third. All after a will is carried through or a debt, which does not cause harm. A directive from God, and God is Knowledgeable, Compassionate.
These are God's limits, and whoever obeys God and His messenger, He will admit him to gardens with rivers flowing beneath, eternally abiding therein. This is the greatest victory.
And whoever disobeys God and His messenger, and transgresses His limits, He will admit him to a Fire in which he abides eternally, and he will have a humiliating retribution.
And the two women who commit lewdness, you shall bring four witnesses over them from amongst you; if they bear witness, then you shall restrict them in the homes until death takes them, or God makes for them a way out.
And the two men who commit it from amongst you, then you shall annoy them. If they repent and amend, then leave them alone. God is Redeemer, Merciful.
Repentance is only for those who commit sin out of ignorance and then repent soon after; these will be forgiven by God, God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
And there will be no repentance for those who commit sin until death comes upon one of them, then he says: "I repent now!", nor for those who die while they are disbelievers. To those We have prepared a painful retribution.
O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit the women by force, nor that you become harsh with them to take away some of what you have given them, unless they commit a clear lewdness. And live with them in kindness. If you dislike them, then perhaps you may dislike something and God makes in it much good.
And if you wish to replace one wife instead of another, and you have given one of them a large amount, then do not take anything from it. Would you take it by falsehood while it is clearly a sin?
And how can you take it when you have become intimate with each other, and the women have taken from you a strong covenant.
And do not marry what your fathers had married from the women, except what has already been done. It is a lewdness, and an abhorrence, and a bad path.
Forbidden for you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your fathers' sisters, and your mothers' sisters, and the daughters of your brother, and the daughters of your sister, and your foster mothers who suckled you, and your sisters from suckling, and the mothers of your wives, and your step-daughters residing in your homes from your wives which you have already consummated the marriage with; if you have not consummated the marriage then there is no sin upon you; and the wives of your sons that are from your seed, and that you join between two sisters except what has already been done. God is Forgiving, Merciful.
And the already married from the women, except those who become widowed; God's scripture is over you; and permitted for you is what is beyond this, if you are seeking with your money to be protected and not for illicit sex. As for those whom you have already had joy with them, then you shall give them their wage as an obligation. There is no sin upon you for what you agree to after the obligation. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
And whoever of you cannot afford to marry the believing independent women, then from the still dependant believing young women. God is more aware of your faith, some of you to each other. You shall marry them with the permission of their parents and give them their wage in kindness; to be protected, not for illicit sex or taking lovers. If they become protected, then any of them who comes with lewdness shall have half the punishment of what is for the independent women of the retribution. This is for those who fear hardship from among you. But if you are patient it is better for you, and God is Forgiver, Merciful.
God wants to make clear for you and guide you to the ways of those before you, and pardon you, and God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
And God wants to pardon you, but those who follow their lusts want that you would be diverted into a great diversion.
God wants to make easy for you; and mankind was created weak.
O you who believe, do not consume your money between you unjustly, except through a trade which is mutually agreed by you. And do not kill yourselves; God is Merciful towards you.
And whoever does so out of animosity and transgression, We will cast him to a Fire; and this for God is very easy.
If you avoid the major sins that you are forbidden against, then We will cancel your existing sins and admit you to a generous entrance.
And do not envy what God has favoured some of you over others. For the men is a portion of what they gained, and for the women is a portion of what they gained. And ask God from His favour, God is knowledgeable over all things.
And for each We have made inheritors for what was left behind by the parents and the relatives. And those whom are dependant on you, you shall give them their portion. God is witness over all things.
The men are to support the women by what God has gifted them over one another and for what they spend of their money. The upright women who are attentive, and keep private the personal matters for what God keeps watch over. As for those women from whom you fear a desertion, then you shall advise them, and abandon them in the bedchamber, and separate from them; if they obey you, then do not seek a way over them; God is High, Great.
And if you fear a split between them, then send a judge from his family and a judge from hers. If they want to reconcile, then God will bring them together. God is Knowledgeable, Expert.
And serve God and do not set up anything with Him, and be kind to the parents, and the relatives, and the needy, and the neighbour who is of kin, and the neighbour next door, and the friend far away, and the traveller, and those who are still dependent. God does not like the arrogant, the boastful.
Those who are stingy and order the people to stinginess, and they conceal what God has given them from His bounty. We have prepared for these disbelievers a painful retribution.
And those who spend their money to show-off to the people, and they do not believe in God or the Last Day. And whoever has the devil as his companion, then what a miserable companion!
What would bother them if they believed in God and the Last Day and spent from God's provisions? God is aware of them.
Indeed, God does not wrong an atom's weight; and if it is good He will double it. And He grants from Himself a great reward.
How is it then when We bring forth from every nation a witness, and bring you as a witness over these?
On that Day those who rejected and disobeyed the messenger will wish that the Earth would swallow them; but they cannot hide anything said from God.
O you who believe, do not come near the contact-method while you are drunk, until you know what you are saying. Nor if you have had intercourse, unless travelling, until you bathe. And if you are ill, or traveling, or one of you has excreted feces, or you had sexual contact with the women, and could not find water: then you shall make ablution with clean soil by wiping your faces and hands. God is Pardoning, Forgiving.
Did you not see those who have been given a portion of the Scripture? They purchased straying, and they want you to stray from the path.
God is fully aware of your enemies; and God is enough as a supporter, and God is enough as a victor.
From amongst the Jews there are those who take the words out of context, and they Say: "We hear and disobey, and listen but let not any listen, and shepherd us," in a twisting of their tongues and as a mockery of the system! And had they said: "We hear and obey, and listen, and watch over us," it would have been better for them and more upright; but God has cursed them for their disbelief, they do not believe except very little.
O you who have received the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down authenticating what is with you, before We cast down faces and turn them on their backs or curse them as the people of the Sabbath were cursed. And God's will is always done.
God does not forgive that partners be set up with Him, and He forgives what is beside that for whom He wills. Whoever sets-up partners with God has indeed invented a great sin.
Did you not see those who boast about themselves? No, it is God who promotes whom He wills, and they will not be wronged in the least.
See how they invent upon God the lies; is that not enough as a clear sin?
Did you not see those who were given a portion of the Scripture, they believe in witchcraft and evil, and they say to those who disbelieved: "You are better guided than those who believed the path."
These are the ones whom God has cursed, and whoever God curses, you will not find for him a victor.
Or would they have a portion of the sovereignty? If so, then they would not give the people a speck.
Or do they envy the people for what God has given them of His bounty? We have given the descendants of Abraham the Scripture and the wisdom; We have given them a great kingship.
Some of them believed in it, and some of them turned from it. In Hell will be enough flames.
Those who have rejected Our signs, We will admit them to a Fire. Every time their skins are cooked, We replace them with other skin that they may taste the retribution. God is Noble, Wise.
And those who believe and do good, We will admit them to gardens with rivers flowing beneath, eternally they abide therein, in it they will have pure spouses, and We will admit them to a vast shade.
God orders you to deliver anything you have been entrusted with to its owners. And if you judge between the people, then you shall judge with justice. It is always the best that God prescribes for you. God is Hearer, Seer.
O you who believe, obey God and obey the messenger and those entrusted amongst you. But if you dispute in any matter, then you shall refer it to God and His messenger if you believe in God and the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for knowing.
Did you not see those who claimed they believed in what was sent down to you and what was sent before you? They wanted to seek judgment using evil, while they were ordered to reject it. It is the devil who wants to lead them far astray.
And if they are told: "Come to what God has sent down and to the messenger," you see the hypocrites turning away from you strongly.
Why then, when a tragedy befalls them for what their hands have brought forth do they come to you swearing by God that they only wanted to do good and reconcile?
These are a people whom God knows what is in their hearts, so turn away from them and advise them, and speak to their souls with a clear saying.
We do not send a messenger except to be obeyed by God's leave. And had they come to you when they had wronged themselves and sought God's forgiveness, and the messenger sought forgiveness for them, they would have then found God to be Pardoning, Merciful.
No, by your Lord, they will not believe until they make you judge in what they dispute with each other, then they will not find in their souls any animosity for what you have decided, and they will yield completely.
And had We decreed for them: "Kill yourselves," or "Leave your land," they would not have done so except for a few of them. And if they had done what they were advised with, it would have been better for them and helped to strengthen them.
Then We would have given them from Us a great reward.
And We would have guided them to a Straight Path.
And whoever obeys God and the messenger will be among those whom God has blessed from the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the upright. What an excellent companionship!
That is the bounty from God; and God knows what is best.
O you who believe, take your precaution by going out in clusters, or going out all together.
And from among you will be those that would lag behind, so that if disaster afflicts you he would Say: "God has blessed me that I was not a martyr with them!"
And if favour from God benefits you, he will speak as if there had been affection between you and him: "Oh, I wish I had been with them so I would win a great prize."
Let those who seek to purchase the Hereafter rather than this world fight in the cause of God. And whoever fights in the cause of God and is killed or attains victory, then We will grant him a great reward.
And why do you not fight in the cause of God, when the weak amongst the men and women and children Say: "Our Lord, bring us out of this town whose people are wicked, and grant us from Yourself a Supporter, and grant us from Yourself a Victor!"
Those who believe fight in the cause of God, while those who reject fight in the cause of evil; so fight the supporters of the devil, for the planning of the devil is weak.
Did you not see those who were told: "Restrain yourselves, and hold the contact-method, and contribute towards betterment." But when fighting was decreed for them, a group of them feared the people as much as they feared God or even more so. And they said: "Our Lord, why did You decree fighting for us? If only You would delay for us till another time." Say: "The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is far better for those who are aware; you will not be wronged in the least."
Wherever you may be, death will find you, even if you are in fortified towers. If any good befalls them, they Say: "This is from God," and if any bad befalls them, they Say: "This is from you!" Say: "All is from God;" what is wrong with these people, they barely understand anything said!
Any good that befalls you is from God, and any bad that befalls you is from yourself. We have sent you as a messenger to the people and God is enough as a witness.
Whoever obeys the messenger has obeyed God; and whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a guardian over them.
And they Say: "Obedience," but when they emerge from you a group of them prepares for other that what you have said, and God records what they planned. So turn away from them and put your trust in God. God is enough for your trust.
Do they not reflect on the Quran? If it was from any other than God they would have found it very different.
And if any matter regarding security, or fear, comes to them they make it publicly known, but if they had referred it to the messenger and to those entrusted from them then it would have been known by those who studied it from them. And had it not been for God's grace upon you and His mercy, you would have followed the devil, except for a few.
So fight in the cause of God; you are not responsible except for yourself. And enjoin the believers: "Perhaps God will put a stop to the might of those who disbelieved." And God is far Mightier and far more Punishing.
Whoever intercedes a good intercession, he will have a reward of it; and whoever intercedes an evil intercession, he will receive a share of it. And God has control over all things.
And if you are greeted with a greeting, then return an even better greeting or return the same. God is Reckoning over all things.
God, there is no god but He. He will gather you for the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt. Who is more truthful in saying than God?
What is the matter with you that you are divided into two groups over the hypocrites, while God has regressed them for what they have earned? Do you want to guide those whom God misguides? Whoever God causes to be misguided, you will never find for him a way.
They hope that you would reject as they rejected, then you would be the same. Do not take any of them as allies until they emigrate in the cause of God. If they turn away, then take them and kill them where you find them; and do not take from them any ally or supporter.
Except for those who reach a people between whom you have a covenant, or if they come to you with a reluctance in their chests to fight you or to fight their own people. Had God willed He would have given them strength and they would have fought you. But if they retire from you, and did not fight you, and they offer you peace; then God does not make for you a way against them.
You will find others who want to be safe amongst you and safe amongst their own people. Every time they are returned to the test, they fall back in it. If they do not withdraw from you, and offer you peace, and restrain their hands, then you shall take them and kill them where you find them. For these We have given you a clear authority.
And it is not for a believer to kill another believer except by accident. And whoever kills a believer by accident, then he shall set free a believing slave, and give compensation to the family; except if they remit it. If he was from a people who are enemies to you, and he was a believer, then you shall set free a believing slave. And if he was from a people between whom you had a covenant, then a compensation to his family, and set free a believing slave. Whoever does not find, then the fasting of two months sequentially as a repentance from God; God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
And whoever kills a believer intentionally, then his reward shall be Hell, eternally abiding therein, and God will be angry with him, and curse him, and for him is prepared a great retribution.
O you who believe, if you attack in the cause of God then make a clear declaration, and do not say to those who greet you with peace: "You are not a believer!" You are seeking the vanity of this world; but with God are many riches. That is how you were before, but God favoured you, so make a clear declaration. God is expert over what you do.
Not equal are those who stayed behind from the believers; except those disabled; with those who strived in the cause of God with their money and lives. God has preferred those who strive with their money and lives over those who stayed behind by a grade; and to both God has promised goodness; and God has preferred the strivers over those who stay by a great reward.
Grades from Him and forgiveness and a mercy. God is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those whom the Angels take, while they had wronged their souls; they said: "What situation were you in?", they said: "We were oppressed on Earth." They said: "Was God's Earth not wide enough that you could emigrate in it?" To these their abode will be Hell; what a miserable destiny!
Except for those who were oppressed from the men, women, and children who could not devise a plan nor could be guided to a way.
For these, perhaps God will pardon them. God is Pardoner, Forgiving.
Whoever emigrates in the cause of God will find in the land many spoils and a bounty. And whoever leaves his home emigrating to God and His messenger, then is overcome by death; his reward has fallen to God, and God is Forgiving, Merciful.
And if you are on the offensive in the land, then there is no harm that you shorten the contact-method, if you fear that the disbelievers will try you. The disbelievers are to you a clear enemy.
And if thou are with them and hold the contact-method for them, then let a group from amongst them stand with you and let them bring their weapons; and when they have prostrated then let them stand guard from behind; and let a group who has not yet contacted come and contact with you, and let them be wary and let them bring their weapons with them. The rejecters hope that you would neglect your weapons and goods so they can come upon you in one blow. There is no sin upon you if you are impeded by rainfall, or if you are ill, that you keep from placing down your weapons. And be wary. God has prepared for the rejecters a humiliating retribution.
So when you are done with the contact-method, then remember God while standing, or sitting, or on your sides. When you are relieved, you shall hold the contact-method; the contact-method for the believers is a scheduled book.
And do not falter in the pursuit of the remaining group. If you are feeling pain, then they are also feeling pain as you are; and you seek from God what they do not seek. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
We have revealed to you the Scripture with truth that you may judge between the people by that which God has shown you, and do not be an advocate for the treacherous.
And seek forgiveness from God; God is Forgiver, Merciful.
And do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves. God does not like those who are betrayers, sinners.
They may conceal this from the people, but they do not conceal it from God, and He was with them when they schemed what He does not approve of to be said. God is Encompassing what they do.
Here you are arguing on their behalf in this world, but who will argue on their behalf with God on the Day of Resurrection? or who will be their sponsor?
And whoever does any evil, or wrongs himself, then seeks God's forgiveness; he will find God Forgiving, Merciful.
And whoever earns any sin, then he has brought it on himself. And God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
And whoever does a mistake or wrongdoing, then blames it on an innocent person; he has incurred falsehood and a clear sin.
And had it not been for God's favour upon you and His mercy, when a group of them were insistent on misguiding you; they would not have misguided except themselves, nor would they harm you in anything. And God has sent down to you the Scripture and the wisdom, and He has taught you that which you did not know. God's grace upon you is great.
There is no good in most of what they desire, except whoever orders a charity or kindness or reconciliation between the people. And whoever does this seeking God's favour, We will give him a great reward.
And whoever is hostile to the messenger after the guidance has been made clear to him, and he follows other than the path of the believers; We will grant him what he has sought and deliver him to Hell; what a miserable destination.
God does not forgive to have partners set up with Him, but He forgives other than that for whom He pleases. Whoever sets-up partners with God has indeed strayed a far straying.
They are only calling on females beside God. Indeed, they are only calling on a persistent devil.
God has cursed him; and he had said: "I will take from Your servants a sizeable portion."
"And I will misguide them and make them desire, and I will command them, so that they will mark the ears of the livestock, and I will command them so they will make change to God's creation." Whoever takes the devil as a supporter other than God, then he has indeed lost a great loss.
He promises them and makes them desire, but what the devil promises them is only vanity.
For these, their abode shall be Hell, they will find no escape from it.
As for those who believe and do good work, We will admit them gardens with rivers flowing beneath, eternally they will abide therein. God's promise is truth; and who is more truthful in saying than God?
It will not be by what you desire, nor by what the people of the Scripture desire. Whoever works evil, he will be paid by it; and he will not find for himself besides than God any supporter or victor.
And whoever works good be he male or female, and he is a believer, then these will be admitted to Paradise, and they will not be wronged in the least.
And who is better in the system than one who surrenders himself to God, and is a good doer, and he followed the creed of Abraham in monotheism? And God has taken Abraham as a friend.
And to God is what is in heavens and in the Earth; God is Encompassing over all things.
And they seek a ruling regarding the women, Say: "God will give you a ruling regarding them and what is being recited to you in the Scripture regarding the orphan's mothers whom you wish to marry, but have not given them what was decreed for them; as well as the weak from the children: That you stand for the orphans in equality." Whatever good you do, then God is aware of it.
And if a woman fears from her husband desertion, or ill-treatment, then there is no sin for them to reconcile between themselves; and reconciliation is good. And the souls are brought by need. And if you are kind and do right, then God is expert over what you do.
And you will not be able to be fair regarding the women even if you make every effort; so do not sway too greatly and leave her as one hanging in a void. And if you reconcile and do right, then God is Forgiving, Merciful.
And if they separate, then God will provide for each of them from His bounty. God is Vast, Wise.
And to God is what is in the heavens and the Earth; and We have recommended to those who were given the Scripture before you, and you, to be aware of God. And if you reject, then to God is all that is in heavens and in Earth; God is Rich, Praiseworthy.
And to God is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the Earth; and God is enough as a Caretaker.
O you people, if He wills, He could make all of you cease to exist; then He would bring others in your place. God is most capable to do this.
Whoever seeks the reward of this world, then with God is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. God is Hearing, Watchful.
O you who believe, stand with justice as witnesses to God, even if against yourselves, or the parents or the relatives. Even if he be rich or poor, God is more worthy of them, so do not follow your desires from being just. And if you twist or turn away, then God is Expert over what you do.
O you who believe; believe in God and His messenger, and the Scripture which was sent down to His messenger, and the Scripture that was sent before. And whoever rejects God, and His Angels, and His Scriptures, and His messengers, and the Last Day; then he has strayed a far straying.
Those who believe, then reject, then believe, then reject, then they increase in rejection; God was neither to forgive them nor to guide them to the path.
Give news to the hypocrites that they will have a painful retribution.
Those who take the rejecters as allies instead of the believers: "Do they seek glory with them?" All glory belongs to God.
And it has been sent down to you in the Scripture, that if you hear God's revelations being rejected and ridiculed in, then do not sit with them until they move on to a different subject; if not, then you are like them. God will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers in Hell all together.
Those who linger and observe you, if you have a victory from God they Say: "Were we not with you?" And if the rejecters have success, they Say: "Did we not side with you and deter the believers from you?" God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection, and God will not grant the rejecters any success over the believers.
The hypocrites seek to deceive God, while He is deceiving them; and if they attend to the contact-method, they do so lazily, only to show the people; they do not remember God except very little.
They are swaying in-between, neither belonging to this group nor to that group. Whoever God will misguide, you will not find for him a way.
O you who believe, do not take the rejecters as allies instead of the believers. Do you want God to have a reason against you?
The hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire; and you will not find for them a victor.
Except those who repent, and amend, and hold fast to God, and purify their system to God; then these will be with the believers. And God will grant the believers a great reward.
What would God want with your punishment if you were only thankful and believed? God is Appreciative, Knowledgeable.
God does not like that any negative sayings be publicized, except if one is wronged. God is Hearer, Knowledgeable.
If you reveal what is good or hide it, or forgive what is bad, then God is Pardoner, Capable.
Those who rejected God and His messengers, and they want to make a distinction between God and His messengers, and they Say: "We believe in some and reject some!", and they desire to take a path in-between.
These are the true rejecters; and We have prepared for the rejecters a humiliating retribution.
And those who believe in God and His messengers and do not make a distinction between any of them, We will give them their rewards. And God is Forgiving, Merciful.
The people of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a scripture from the heavens. They had asked Moses for even more than that, for they said: "Let us see God plainly!", so the lightning bolt took them for their wickedness. Then they took the calf after the clarity had come to them, and We pardoned them for this; We gave Moses a clear authority.
And We raised the mount above them for the covenant they took, and We said to them: "Enter the gate while prostrating," and We said to them: "Do not transgress the Sabbath," and We took from them a solemn covenant.
So, for the breaking of their covenant, and their rejection of God's signs, and their killing of the prophets without justice, and their saying: "Our hearts are layered over." Indeed, God has stamped upon their hearts because of their rejection; they do not believe, except for a few.
And for their rejection and them saying about Mary a great falsehood.
And their saying: "We have killed the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary, the messenger of God!" They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. Those who dispute are in doubt of him, they have no knowledge except to follow conjecture; they did not kill him for a certainty.
For God raised him to Himself; and God is Noble, Wise.
And from the people of the Scripture are few who would have believed in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be witness against them.
Because of the wickedness from those who are Jews, We made forbidden to them the good things that were lawful to them; and for their deterring many from the path of God.
And for them taking financial interest when they were told not to, and for them consuming peoples money unjustly. We have prepared for the disbelievers amongst them a painful retribution.
But those of them who are firm in knowledge, as well as the believers, they believe in what was sent down to you and what was sent down before you; and those who hold the contact-method, and those who contribute towards betterment, and those who believe in God and the Last Day; to these We will give them their reward greatly.
We have inspired you as We have inspired Noah and the prophets after him. And We inspired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job, and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon; and We have given David the Psalms.
And messengers of whom We have narrated to you from before, and messengers We have not narrated to you; and God spoke to Moses directly.
Messengers who were bearers of good news and warners, so that there will be no excuse for the people with God after the messengers. God is Noble, Wise.
But God bears witness for what He has sent down to you with His knowledge, and the Angels bear witness; and God is enough as a witness.
Those who have rejected and turned away from the path of God, they have strayed a far straying.
Those who have rejected and did wrong, God was not to forgive them, nor guide them to a path.
Except to the path of Hell, in it they will abide eternally. For God this is very easy.
O people, a messenger has come to you with truth from your Lord, so believe; that is better for you. And if you disbelieve, then to God is what is in heavens and Earth. And God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
O people of the Scripture, do not overstep in your system, nor say about God except the truth. Jesus the son of Mary was no more than God's messenger and the fulfillment of His word to Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and do not Say: "Trinity." Cease, for it is better for you. God is only One god, be He glorified that He should have a son! To Him is all that is in the heavens and what is in the Earth. God is enough as a caretaker.
The Messiah is not too proud to be a servant to God, nor are the Angels who are close to Him. Whoever is too proud from His service, and is arrogant, then He will gather them all towards Him together.
As for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their rewards and increase for them from His bounty. And as for those who are too proud and arrogant, He will punish them a painful retribution, and they will not find besides God any supporter or victor.
O people, a proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a guiding light.
As for those who believe in God and hold fast to Him, He will admit them in a mercy from Him and a bounty, and He will guide them to Himself, a Straight Path.
They seek a ruling from you, Say: "God gives you the ruling for those who have no descendants. If a person passes away and has no children but has a sister, then she shall receive half of what he leaves behind. And he will inherit her fully if she has no child. However, if he has two sisters, then they will receive two thirds of what he left behind; and if he has siblings, male and female, then the male shall receive twice what the female receives." God makes clear to you that you do not stray; God is aware of all things.
