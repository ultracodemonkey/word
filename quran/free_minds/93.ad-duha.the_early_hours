By the late morning.
And the night when it falls.
Your Lord has not left you, nor did He forget.
And the Hereafter is better for you than the first.
And your Lord will give you and you will be pleased.
Did he not find you an orphan and He sheltered you?
And He found you lost, and He guided you?
And He found you in need, so He gave you riches?
As for the orphan, you shall not make him sad.
And as for the beggar, you shall not reprimand.
And you shall proclaim the blessings from your Lord.
