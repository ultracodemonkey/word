By the fast gallopers.
Striking sparks.
Charging in the morning.
Forming clouds of dust.
Penetrating to the midst together.
Surely, the human being is ungrateful to his Lord.
He will indeed bear witness to this.
He loves wealth tenaciously.
Does he not realise that when what is in the graves are scattered.
And what is in the chests is gathered.
That their Lord has been fully cognizant of them?
