Those who rejected amongst the people of the Scripture and those who set up partners would not leave until proof came to them.
A messenger from God reciting purified scripts.
In them are valuable books.
And those who had previously received the Scripture did not divide except after the proof came to them.
And they were not commanded except to serve God and be loyal to His system, monotheists, and hold the contact-method and contribute towards betterment. Such is the valuable system.
Those who rejected from the people of the Scripture and those who set up partners are in the fires of Hell abiding therein, those are the worst of creation.
As for those who believe and do good works, they are the best of creation.
Their reward with their Lord is the gardens of Eden with rivers flowing beneath them, they abide eternally therein. God is satisfied with them, and they are satisfied with Him. That is for whoever feared His Lord.
