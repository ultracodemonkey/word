A.L.M.R. These are the signs of the Scripture. And what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth; but most of the people do not believe.
God, Who raised the skies without any pillars that you can see, then He settled to the throne, and He commissioned the sun and the moon; each running to a fixed destiny. He manages all affairs, and He details the signs so that you will be aware of the meeting with your Lord.
And He is the One who stretched-out the land, and made in it stabilizers and rivers, and from every fruit He made a pair of two; the night covers the day. In that are signs for a people who will think.
And on Earth are neighbouring pieces of land with gardens of grape and plants and palm trees, some of which may be twin sharing the same root, or single, even though they are being watered with the same water source; and We make preference for some of them over others in what they consume. In that are signs for a people who comprehend.
And if you are surprised, then what is more surprising is their saying: "Can it be that when we are dust, we will be created anew!" These are the ones who rejected their Lord, and they will have chains around their necks, and they are the dwellers of the Fire, in it they will abide.
And they hasten towards you with sin before good, and the examples of those before them have already been given. Your Lord is with great forgiveness to mankind for their transgression, and your Lord is severe in retribution.
And those who reject Say: "If only a sign was sent down to him from his Lord." You are but a warner, and to every nation is a guide.
God knows what every female carries, and how short her pregnancy or how long. And everything with Him is measured.
The knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the most High.
It is the same whether any of you openly declares what he says, or conceals it; whether he is hiding in the night or going openly in the day.
Present with him and behind him are retainers, they guard him by God's command. God is not to change what is in a people until they change what is within themselves. And if God wanted to harm a people, then there is no turning Him back, nor will they have any protector against Him.
He is the One who shows you the lightning, giving you fear and hope. And He establishes the heavy clouds.
And the thunder glorifies with His praise, and the Angels are in awe of Him, and He sends the thunderbolts, and strikes with it whom He will. Yet they are still arguing regarding God, while He is severe in punishment.
To Him is the call of truth. And those who are called on besides Him, they will not respond to them in anything; like one who places his hands openly in the water to drink, but it never reaches his mouth. The call of the rejecters is nothing but in misguidance.
And to God submit all who are in the heavens and the Earth, willingly and unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening.
Say: "Who is the Lord of the heavens and Earth," Say: "God." Say: "Have you taken besides Him allies who do not posses for themselves any benefit or harm?" Say: "Is the blind and the seer the same?, or does the darkness and the light equate? Or have they made partners with God who have created like His creation, so the creations all seemed the same to them?" Say: "God has created all things, and He is the One, the Supreme."
He sent down water from the sky, so valleys flowed according to their capacity, and the flood produces foam. And from what they burn to smelt jewellery or goods is produced a similar foam. It is in such a manor that God strikes the falsehood with the truth. As for the foam, it passes away, and as for what benefits mankind, it remains in the Earth. It is such that God cites the examples.
For those who responded to their Lord is goodness. As for those who did not respond to Him, if they had all that is in the Earth twice over, they would offer it to be saved. To these will be a terrible reckoning, and their abode is Hell; what a miserable abode.
Is one who knows that the truth has been sent down to you from your Lord like one who is blind? Only those with understanding will remember.
Those who fulfill God's pledge, and they do not break the Covenant.
And those who deliver what God has ordered be delivered, and they revere their Lord and they fear the terrible reckoning.
And those who are patient seeking their Lord's direction; and they hold the contact-method, and they spend from what We bestowed upon them secretly and openly, and they counter sin with good; these will have an excellent abode.
The gardens of Eden, they will enter it with those who are good doers from their fathers and their mates and their progeny. And the Angels will enter upon them from every gate.
"Peace be upon you for what you have been patient for. Excellent indeed is the final abode."
As for those who break the pledge of God after making its covenant, and they sever what God ordered that it be delivered, and they corrupt in the Earth; to those is a curse and they will have a miserable abode.
God gives the provisions for whom He wishes, and He is able. And they were happy with the worldly life, but the worldly life compared to the Hereafter was nothing but a brief enjoyment.
And those who have rejected Say: "If only a sign were sent down to him from his Lord!" Say: "God misguides whom He wishes and guides to Him whoever is repenting."
The ones who believed and their hearts are relieved by the remembrance of God; for in God's remembrance the hearts are relieved.
And those who believed, and did good works, there will be happiness for them and a good abode.
And as such, We have sent you to a nation as other nations that have come before, so that you may recite for them that which has been inspired to you; while they are still rejecting the Almighty. Say: "He is my Lord, there is no god but He, in Him I place my trust and to Him is my repentance."
And if a Quran were to be used to move mountains, or to slice the Earth, or the dead were spoken to with it. No, to God is all matters. Did not those who believe know that if God wished He would have guided all the people? As for those who reject, they continue to be stricken with disaster or it comes near to their homes, until God's promise comes true. God does not break the appointment.
And messengers before you were ridiculed, but I gave time to those who rejected, then I took them. Then how was My punishment?
The One who is standing over every soul for what it has earned; yet they make partners with God. Say: "Name them?, or are you informing Him of what He does not know on Earth or is it just a show of words?" But to the rejecters, their scheming is made to appear clever, and they are turned away from the path. And whoever God misguides will have no guide.
They will have a punishment in the worldly life, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more difficult. And they will have no defender against God.
The example of Paradise that the righteous have been promised, is that rivers flow beneath it, and its provisions are continuous as is its shade. Such is the abode of those who were righteous, while the abode of the rejecters is the Fire.
And those to whom We have previously given the Scripture rejoice at what has been sent down to you, but there are some of the groups that reject parts of it. Say: "I am only ordered to serve God and not join any partner with Him. To Him I pray and to Him is the return."
And as such, We have sent it down a law in Arabic. And if you follow their desires after what has come to you of the knowledge, then you will not have any ally or defender against God.
And We have sent messengers before you and We have made for them mates and offspring. It was not for a messenger to come with any sign except by God's leave, but for every time there is a decree.
God erases what He wishes and affirms, and with Him is the source of the Scripture.
And if We show you some of what We promise them or if We let you pass away, then you are only to deliver while for Us is the reckoning.
Do they not see that We come to the land and reduce it from its ends? And God gives judgment and there is none to override His judgment. And He is quick to reckoning.
And those before them have schemed, but to God is all scheming. He knows what every soul earns and the rejecters will come to know to whom is the better abode.
And those who reject Say: "You are not a messenger." Say: "God is sufficient as a witness between me and you, the One who has the knowledge of the Scripture."
