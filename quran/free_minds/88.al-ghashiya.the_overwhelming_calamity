Has the news come to you of that which will overwhelm?
Faces on that Day which will be shamed.
Labouring and weary.
They will enter a blazing Fire.
And be given to drink from a boiling spring.
They will have no food except from a thorny plant.
It does not nourish nor avail against hunger.
And faces on that Day which are soft.
For their pursuit they are content.
In a high paradise.
You will not hear in it any nonsense.
In it is a running spring.
In it are raised beds.
And cups that are set.
And cushions set in rows.
And rich carpets spread out.
Will they not look at the camels, how are they created?
And to the sky, how is it raised?
And to the mountains, how was it set?
And to the land, how was it flattened?
So remind, for you are but a reminder.
You have no power over them.
Except for he who turns away and rejects.
Then God will punish him with the great retribution.
Indeed, to Us is their return.
Then to Us is their judgment.
