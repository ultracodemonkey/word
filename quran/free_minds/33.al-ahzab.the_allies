O you prophet, you shall be aware of God, and do not obey the rejecters and the hypocrites. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.
And follow what is being revealed to you by your Lord. God is fully aware of all that you do.
And put your trust in God. God suffices as an advocate.
God did not make any man with two hearts in his body. Nor did He make your wives whom you estrange to be as your mothers. Nor did He make your adopted children to be your sons. Such is what you claim with your mouths, but God speaks the truth, and He guides to the path.
Name them by retaining their father's name. That is more just with God. But if you do not know their fathers, then, as your brothers in the system and members of your family. There is no sin upon you if you make a mistake in this respect; but you will be responsible for what your hearts deliberately intend. God is Forgiver, Merciful.
The prophet is closer to the believers than themselves, and his wives are mothers to them. And God's decree to the believers and the emigrants is that before they help their relatives, they have taken care of their own families first. Such has been decreed in the Scripture.
And when We took from the prophets their covenant. And from you, and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary; We took from them a strong covenant.
So that the truthful may be asked about their truthfulness, and He has prepared for the rejecters a painful retribution.
O you who believe, remember God's favour upon you when soldiers attacked you and We sent upon them a wind and invisible soldiers. God is Seer of everything you do.
For they came from above you, and from beneath you; and your eyes were terrified, and the hearts reached to the throat, and you harboured doubts about God.
That is when the believers were truly tested; they were severely shaken up.
And the hypocrites and those who have a sickness in their hearts said: "God and His messenger promised us nothing but illusions!"
And a group of them said: "O people of Yathrib, you cannot make a stand; therefore, retreat." And a small party of them sought permission from the prophet, saying: "Our homes are exposed," while they were not exposed. They just wanted to flee.
And if the enemy had entered at them from all sides, and then they were asked to betray, they would do so with very little hesitation.
And indeed they had pledged to God before this that they would not turn around and flee. Making a pledge to God brings great responsibility.
Say: "It will not benefit you to flee away from death or from being killed, for you will only have the enjoyment for a short while."
Say: "Who can protect you from God if He intends to harm you, or He intends any blessing for you?" They will never find besides God any ally or victor.
God already knows which of you are the hinderers, and those who say to their brothers: "Come and stay with us." Rarely do they mobilize for battle.
They are miserable towards you. Then, when fear comes, you see their eyes rolling, as if death had already come to them. But once the fear is gone, they lash-out at you with sharp tongues. They are miserable towards doing any good. These have not believed, so God nullifies their works. This is easy for God to do.
They thought that the opponents had not yet mobilized. And if the opponents do appear, they wish that they were out in the desert, seeking out news for you. Even if they were among you, they would not have fought except very little.
Indeed, in the messenger of God a good example has been set for you for he who seeks God and the Last Day and thinks constantly about God.
And when the believers saw the opponents, they said: "This is what God and His messenger have promised us, and God and His messenger are truthful." This only increased their faith and their surrender.
From among the believers are men who fulfilled their pledge to God. Thus, some of them died, while some are still waiting; but they never altered in the least.
That God may recompense the truthful for their truthfulness, and punish the hypocrites if He so wills, or accepts their repentance. God is Forgiver, Merciful.
And God drove back those who disbelieved with their rage, they left empty handed. God thus spared the believers any fighting. God is Powerful, Noble.
And He also brought down those who helped support them from among the people of the Scripture from their secure positions, and He threw terror into their hearts. Some of them you killed, and some you took captive.
And He inherited you their land, their homes, their money, and lands you had never stepped on. God is able to do all things.
O prophet, say to your wives: "If you are seeking this worldly life and its vanities, then come, I will make a provision for you and release you in an amicable manner."
"But if you are seeking God and His messenger, and the abode of the Hereafter, then God has prepared for the righteous among you a great reward."
O wives of the prophet, if any of you commits evident lewdness, then the retribution will be doubled for her. This is easy for God to do.
Any whosoever of you is obedient to God and His messenger, and does good works, We will grant her double the recompense, and We have prepared for her a generous provision.
O wives of the prophet, you are not like any other women. If you are righteous, then do not speak too softly, lest those with disease in their hearts will move with desire; you shall speak in an honourable manner.
You shall settle down in your homes, and do not be about like the olden days of ignorance. You shall hold the contact-method, and contribute towards betterment, and obey God and His messenger. God wishes to remove any affliction from you, O people of the sanctuary, and to purify you completely.
And mention all that is being recited in your homes of God's revelations and the wisdom. God is Sublime, Expert.
Surely, the surrendering men, and the surrendering women, the believing men, and the believing women, the obedient men, and the obedient women, the truthful men, and the truthful women, the patient men, and the patient women, the humble men, and the humble women, the charitable men, and the charitable women, the fasting men, and the fasting women, the men who keep covered their private parts, and the women who similarly keep covered, and the men who commemorate God frequently, and the commemorating women; God has prepared for them a forgiveness and a great recompense.
It is not for a believing man or believing woman, if God and His messenger issue any command, that they have any choice in their decision. And anyone who disobeys God and His messenger, he has gone far astray.
And you said to the one who was blessed by God, and blessed by you: "Keep your wife and reverence God," and you hid inside yourself what God wished to proclaim. And you feared the people, while it was God you were supposed to fear. So when Zayd ended his relationship with his wife, We had you marry her, to establish that there is no wrongdoing for the believers in marrying the wives of their adopted sons if their relationship is ended. And God's command is always done.
There is no blame on the prophet in doing anything that God has decreed upon him. Such was God's way with the people of old. And God's command is a determined duty.
Those who deliver God's messages, and reverence Him, and they do not reverence anyone but God. God suffices as a Reckoner.
Mohammed was not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of God and the seal of the prophets. And God is fully aware of all things.
O you who believe, you shall remember God frequently.
And glorify Him morning and evening.
He is the One who reaches out to you, along with His Angels, to lead you out of darkness into the light. And He is ever Merciful towards the believers.
Their greeting the Day they meet Him is: "Peace" and He has prepared for them a generous recompense.
O prophet, We have sent you as a witness, and a bearer of good news, and a warner.
Inviting to God, by His leave, and a guiding beacon.
And give good news to the believers, that they have deserved from God a great blessing.
And do not obey the rejecters and the hypocrites, and ignore their insults, and put your trust in God; God suffices as an advocate.
O you who believe, if you marry the believing women, then divorced them before having intercourse with them, then there is no interim required of them. You shall compensate them, and let them go in an amicable manner.
O prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives to whom you have already given their dowry, and the one who is committed to you by oath, as granted to you by God, and the daughters of your father's brothers, and the daughters of your father's sisters, and the daughters of your mother's brothers, and the daughters of your mother's sisters, of whom they have emigrated with you. Also, the believing woman who had decreed herself to the prophet, the prophet may marry her if he wishes, as a privilege given only to you and not to the believers. We have already decreed their rights in regard to their spouses and those who are still dependant. This is to spare you any hardship. God is Forgiver, Merciful.
You may postpone whom you will of them, and you may receive whom you will. And whomsoever you seek of those whom you have set aside then there is no sin upon you. Such is best that they may be comforted and not grieve, and may all be pleased with what you give them. God knows what is in your hearts. God is Knowledgeable, Compassionate.
No women are lawful to you beyond this, nor that you change them for other wives, even though you may be attracted by their beauty, except those to whom you are committed by oaths. And God is watchful over all things.
O you who believe, do not enter the prophet's homes except if you are invited to a meal, without you forcing such an invitation. But if you are invited, you may enter. And when you finish eating, you shall leave, without staying to wait for news. This used to annoy the prophet, and he was shy to tell you. But God does not shy away from the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to harm God's messenger, nor that you should marry his wives after him. This is indeed a gross offence with God.
If you reveal anything, or hide it, God is fully aware of all things.
There is no sin upon them before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their offspring yet to come, or their women, or those who are still their dependants. And be aware of God, for God is witness over all things.
God and His Angels reach out to the prophet. O you who believe, you shall reach out to him, and yield completely.
Surely those who harm God and His messenger, God will curse them in this life and in the Hereafter; and He has prepared for them a shameful retribution.
And those who harm the believing men and the believing women, with no just reason, they have brought upon themselves a slander and a gross sin.
O prophet, tell your wives, your daughters, and the wives of the believers that they should lengthen upon themselves their outer garments. That is better so that they would be recognized and not harmed. God is Forgiver, Merciful.
If the hypocrites, and those with disease in their hearts and those who spread lies in the city do not refrain, then We will let you overpower them, then they will not be able to remain as your neighbours except for a short while.
They are cursed wherever they are found, and they are taken and killed in numbers.
This is God's way with those who have passed away before, and you will not find any change in God's way.
The people ask you regarding the Hour. Say: "Its knowledge is with God. And for all that you know the Hour may be near!"
God has cursed the rejecters, and He has prepared for them Hell.
Eternally they abide therein. They will find no ally, or victor.
On the Day when their faces will be turned over in the Fire, they will Say: "Oh, we wish we had obeyed God, and obeyed the messenger"
And they will Say: "Our Lord, we have obeyed our leaders and our learned ones, but they misled us from the path."
"Our Lord, give them double the retribution, and curse them with a mighty curse."
O you who believe, do not be like those who harmed Moses, but then God cleared him of all they said, and he was honourable before God.
O you who believe, be aware of God and speak only the truth.
He will then direct your works, and forgive your sins. And whosoever obeys God and His messenger has triumphed a great triumph.
We have offered the trust to the heavens and the Earth, and the mountains, but they refused to bear it, and were fearful of it. But the human being accepted it; he was transgressing, ignorant.
So that God may punish the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, and the men who set up partners and the women who set up partners. And God redeems the believing men and the believing women. And God is Forgiver, Merciful.
