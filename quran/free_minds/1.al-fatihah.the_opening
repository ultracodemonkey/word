In the name of God, the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.
The Almighty, the Most Merciful.
Possessor of the Day of Judgment.
You alone we serve, and You alone we seek for help.
Guide us to the straight path.
The path of those whom You have blessed, not those who have incurred the wrath, nor the misguided.
