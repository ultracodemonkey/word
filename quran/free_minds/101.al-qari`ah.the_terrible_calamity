The Shocker.
What is the Shocker?
And how would you know what the Shocker is?
The Day when people come out like swarms of butterflies.
And the mountains will be like fluffed up wool.
As for him whose weights are heavy.
He will be in a happy life.
As for him whose weights are light.
His destiny is the lowest.
And how would you know what it is?
A blazing Fire.
