When the Earth shakes its shaking.
And the Earth brings out its loads.
And man will Say: "What is wrong with it?"
On that Day it will inform its news.
That your Lord had inspired it to do so.
On that Day, the people will be brought out in throngs to be shown their works.
So whoever does an atoms weight of good will see it.
And whoever does an atoms weight of evil will see it.
