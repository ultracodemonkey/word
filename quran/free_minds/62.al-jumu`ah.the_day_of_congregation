Glorifying God is everything in the heavens and everything on the Earth; the King, the Holy, the Noble, the Wise.
He is the One who sent to the Gentiles a messenger from among themselves, to recite to them His revelations, and to purify them, and teach them the Scripture and the wisdom. And before this, they were clearly astray.
And to other generations subsequent to them. He is the Noble, the Wise.
Such is God's grace, which He bestows upon whomever He wills. God is Possessor of Infinite Grace.
The example of those who were given the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, is like the donkey that is carrying a burden of books. Miserable indeed is the example of people who denied God's revelations. And God does not guide the wicked people.
Say: "O you who are Jewish, if you claim that you are God's chosen, to the exclusion of all other people, then you should long for death if you are truthful!"
But they will never long for it, because of what their hands have brought forth. God is fully aware of the wicked.
Say: "The death that you are fleeing from, it will come to find you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of all secrets and declarations, then He will inform you of everything you had done."
O you who believe, if the contact-method is called to on the day of assembly, then you shall hasten towards the remembrance of God, and cease all selling. This is better for you, if you only knew.
Then, once the contact-method is complete, you shall disperse through the land and seek God's provisions, and remember God frequently, that you may succeed.
And if they come across any trade, or some entertainment, they rush to it and leave you standing! Say: "What God possesses is far better than entertainment or trade. And God is the best Provider."
