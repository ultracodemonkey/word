Verily We sent down the Koran in the night of al Kadr.
And what shall make thee understand how excellent the night of al Kadr is?
The night of al Kadr is better than a thousand months.
Therein do the angels descend, and the spirit Gabriel also, by the permission of their Lord, with his decrees concerning every matter.
It is peace, until the rising of the morn.
