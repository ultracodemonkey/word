Have We not opened thy breast;
and eased thee of thy burden,
which galled thy back;
and raised thy reputation for thee?
Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease.
Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease.
When thou shalt have ended thy preaching, labour to serve God in return for his favours;
and make thy supplication unto thy Lord.
