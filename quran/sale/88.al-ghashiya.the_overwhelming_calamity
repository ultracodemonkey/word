Hath the news of the overwhelming day of judgement reached thee?
The countenances of some, on that day, shall be cast down;
labouring and toiling:
They shall be cast into scorching fire to be broiled:
They shall be given to drink of a boiling fountain:
They shall have no food, but of dry thorns and thistles;
which shall not fatten, neither shall they satisfy hunger.
But the countenances of others, on that day, shall be joyful;
well pleased with their past endeavour:
They shall be placed in a lofty garden,
wherein thou shalt hear no vain discourse:
Therein shall be a running fountain:
Therein shall be raised beds,
and goblets placed before them,
and cushions laid in order,
and carpets ready spread.
Do they not consider the camels, how they are created;
and the heaven, how it is raised;
and the mountains, how they are fixed;
and the earth, how it is extended?
Wherefore warn thy people; for thou art a warner only:
Thou art not impowered to act with authority over them.
But whoever shall turn back, and disbelieve,
God shall punish him with the greater punishment of the life to come.
Verily unto us shall they return:
Then shall it be our part to bring them to account.
