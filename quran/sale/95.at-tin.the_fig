By the fig, and the olive;
and by mount Sinai,
and this territory of security:
Verily We created man of a most excellent fabric;
afterwards We rendered him the vilest of the vile:
Except those who believe, and work righteousness; for they shall receive an endless reward.
What therefore shall cause thee to deny the day of judgement after this?
Is not God the most wise judge?
