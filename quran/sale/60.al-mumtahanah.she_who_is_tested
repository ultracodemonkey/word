O true believers, take not my enemy and your enemy for your friends, shewing kindness toward them; since they believe not in the truth which hath come unto you, having expelled the Apostle and yourselves from your native city, because ye believe in God, your Lord. If ye go forth to fight in defence of my religion, and out of a desire to please me, and privately shew friendship unto them; verily I well know that which ye conceal, and that which ye discover: And whoever of you doth this, hath already erred from the strait path.
If they get the better of you, they will be enemies unto you, and they will stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil: And they earnestly desire that ye should become unbelievers.
Neither your kindred nor your children will avail you at all on the day of resurrection, which will separate you from one another: And God seeth that which ye do.
Ye have an excellent pattern in Abraham, and those who were with him, when they said unto their people, verily we are clear of you, and of the idols which ye worship, besides God: We have renounced you; and enmity and hatred is begun between us and you for ever, until ye believe in God alone: Except Abraham's saying unto his father, verily I will beg pardon for thee; but I cannot obtain ought of God in thy behalf. O Lord, in thee do we trust, and unto thee are we turned; and before thee shall we be assembled hereafter.
O Lord, suffer us not to be put to trial by the unbelievers: And forgive us, O Lord; for thou art mighty and wise.
Verily ye have in them an excellent example, unto him who hopeth in God and the last day: And whoso turneth back; verily God is self sufficient, and praise worthy.
Peradventure God will establish friendship between yourselves and such of them as ye now hold for enemies: For God is powerful; and God is inclined to forgive, and merciful.
As to those who have not born arms against you on account of religion, nor turned you out of your dwellings, God forbideth you not to deal kindly with them, and to behave justly towards them; for God loveth those who act justly.
But as to those who have born arms against you on account of religion, and have dispossessed you of your habitations, and have assisted in dispossessing you, God forbideth you to enter into friendship with them: And whosoever of you enters into friendship with them, those are unjust doers.
O true believers, when believing women come unto you as refugees, try them: God well knoweth their faith. And if ye know them to be true believers, send them not back to the infidels: They are not lawful for the unbelievers to have in marriage; neither are the unbelievers lawful for them. But give their unbelieving husbands what they shall have expended for their dowers. Nor shall it be any crime in you if ye marry them, provided ye give them their dowries. And retain not the patronage of the unbelieving women: But demand back that which ye have expended for the dowry of such of your wives as go over to the unbelievers; and let them demand back that which they have expended for the dowry of those who come over to you. This is the judgement of God, which He establisheth among you: And God is knowing and wise.
If any of your wives escape from you to the unbelievers, and ye have your turn by the coming over of any of the unbelievers wives to you; give unto those believers whose wives shall have gone away, out of the dowries of the latter, so much as they shall have expended for the dowers of the former: And fear God, in whom ye believe.
O prophet, when believing women come unto thee, and plight their faith unto thee, that they will not associate any thing with God, nor steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill their children, nor come with a calumny which they have forged between their hands and their feet, nor be disobedient to thee in that which shall be reasonable: Then do thou plight thy faith unto them, and ask pardon for them of God; for God is inclined to forgive, and merciful.
O true believers, enter not into friendship with a people against whom God is incensed: They despair of the life to come, as the infidels despair of the resurrection of those who dwell in the graves.
