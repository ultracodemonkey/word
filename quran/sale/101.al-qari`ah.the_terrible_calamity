The striking!
What is the striking?
And what shall make thee to understand how terrible the striking will be?
On that day men shall be like moths scattered abroad,
and the mountains shall become like carded wool of various colours driven by the wind.
Moreover he whose balance shall be heavy with good works,
shall lead a pleasing life:
But as to him whose balance shall be light,
his dwelling shall be the pit of hell.
What shall make thee to understand how frightful the pit of hell is?
It is a burning fire.
