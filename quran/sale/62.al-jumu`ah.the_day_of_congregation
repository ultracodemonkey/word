Whatever is in heaven and earth praiseth God; the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise.
It is He who hath raised up a midst the illiterate Arabians an Apostle from among themselves, to rehearse his signs unto them, and to purify them, and to teach them the scriptures and wisdom; whereas before they were certainly in a manifest error:
And others of them have not yet attained unto them, by embracing the faith; though they also shall be converted in God's good time; for He is mighty and wise.
This is the free grace of God: He bestoweth the same on whom He pleaseth : And God is indued with great beneficence.
The likeness of those who were charged with the observance of the law, and then observed it not, is as the likeness of an ass laden with books: How wretched is the likeness of the people who charge the signs of God with falsehood! And God directeth not the unjust people.
Say, O ye who follow the Jewish religion, if ye say that ye are the friends of God above other men, wish for death, if ye speak truth.
But they will never wish for it, bacause of that which their hands have sent before them: And God well knoweth the unjust.
Say, verily death, from which ye fly, will surely meet you: Then shall ye be brought before Him who knoweth as well what is concealed as what is discovered; and He will delare unto you that which ye have done.
O true believers, when ye are called to prayer on the day of the assembly, hasten to the commemoration of God, and leave merchandizing. This will be better for you, is ye knew it.
And when prayer is ended, then disperse yourselves through the land as ye list, and seek gain of the liberality of God: And remember God frequently, that ye may prosper.
But when they see any merchandizing, or sport, they flock thereto, and leave thee standing up in thy pulpit. Say, the reward which is with God is better than any sport or merchandize: And God is the best provider.
