I swear by this territory,
-- and thou, O prophet, residest in this territory, --
and by the begetter, and that which He hath begotten;
verily We have created man in misery.
Doth he think that none shall prevail over him?
He saith, I have wasted plenty of riches.
Doth he think that none seeth him?
Have we not made him two eyes,
and a tongue, and two lips;
and shewn him the two highways of good and evil?
Yet he attempteth not the cliff.
What shall make thee to understand what the cliff is?
It is to free the captive;
or to feed, in the day of famine,
the orphan who is of kin,
or the poor man who lieth on the ground.
Whoso doth this, and is one of those who believe, and recommend perseverance unto each other, and recommend mercy unto each other;
these shall be the companions of the right-hand.
But they who shall disbelieve our signs, shall be the companions of the left-hand:
Above them shall be arched fire.
