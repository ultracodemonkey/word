The emulous desire of multiplying riches and children employeth you,
until ye visit the graves.
By no means should ye thus employ your time: Hereafter shall ye know your folly.
Again, by no means: Hereafter shall ye know your folly.
By no means: If ye knew the consequence hereof with certainty of knowledge, ye would not act thus.
Verily ye shall see hell:
Again, ye shall surely see it with the eye of certainty.
Then shall ye be examined, on that day, concerning the pleasures with which ye have amused yourselves in this life.
