A.L.M.
These are the signs of the wise book,
a direction, and a mercy unto the righteous;
who observe the appointed times of prayer, and give alms, and have firm assurance in the life to come:
These are directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper.
There is a man who purchaseth a ludicrous story, that he may seduce men from the way of God, without knowledge, and may laugh the same to scorn: These shall suffer a shameful punishment.
And when our signs are rehearsed unto him, he disdainfully turneth his back, as though he heard them not, as though there were a deafness in his ears: Wherefore denounce unto him a grievous punishment.
But they who shall believe, and work righteousness, shall enjoy gardens of pleasure;
they shall continue therein for ever: This is the certain promise of God; and he is the mighty, the wise.
He hath created the heavens without visible pillars to sustain them, and hath thrown on the earth mountains firmly rooted, lest it should move with you; and He hath replenished the same with all kinds of beasts: And We send down rain from heaven, and cause every kind of noble vegetable to spring forth therein.
This is the creation of God: Shew Me now what they have created, who are worshipped besides Him? Verily the ungodly are in a manifest error.
We heretofore bestowed wisdom on Lokman, and commanded him, saying, be thou thankful unto God: For whoever is thankful, shall be thankful to the advantage of his own soul; and if any shall be unthankful, verily God is self-sufficient, and worthy to be praised.
And remember when Lokman said unto his son, as he admonished him, O my son, give not a partner unto God; for polytheism is a great impiety.
We have commanded man concerning his parents, -- his mother carrieth him in her womb with weakness and faintness, and he is weaned in two years, -- saying, be grateful unto Me, and to thy parents. Unto Me shall all come to be judged.
But if thy parents endeavour to prevail on thee to associate with Me that concerning which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not: Bear them company in this world in what shall be reasonable; but follow the way of him who sincerely turneth unto Me. Hereafter unto Me shall ye return, and then will I declare unto you that which ye have done.
O my son, verily every matter, whether good or bad, though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and be hidden in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring the same to light; for God is clear-sighted and knowing.
O my son, be constant at prayer, and command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil: And be patient under the afflictions which shall befall thee; for this is a duty absolutely incumbent on all men.
Distort not thy face out of contempt to men, neither walk in the earth with insolence; for God loveth no arrogant, vain-glorious person.
And be moderate in thy pace: And lower thy voice; for the most ungrateful of all voices surely is the voice of asses.
Do ye not see that God hath subjected whatever is in heaven and on earth to your service, and hath abundantly poured on you his favours, both outwardly and inwardly? There are some men who dispute concerning God without knowledge, and without a direction, and without an enlightening book.
And when it is said unto them, follow that which God hath revealed; they answer, nay, we will follow that which we found our fathers to practise. What, though the devil invite them to the torment of hell?
Whoever resigneth himself unto God, being a worker of righteousness, taketh hold on a strong handle; and unto God belongeth the issue of all things.
But whoever shall be an unbeliever, let not his unbelief grieve thee: Unto Us shall they return; then will We declare unto them that which they have done, for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men.
We will suffer them to enjoy this world for a little while: Afterwards We will drive them to a severe punishment.
If thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer, God. Say, God be praised! But the greater part of them do not understand.
Unto God belongeth whatever is in heaven and earth: For God is the self-sufficient, the praise-worthy.
If whatever trees are in the earth were pens, and he should after that swell the sea into seven seas of ink, the words of God would not be exhausted; for God is mighty, and wise.
Your creation and your resuscitation are but as the creation and resuscitation of one soul: Verily God both heareth and seeth.
Dost thou not see that God causeth the night to succeed the day, and causeth the day to succeed the night, and compelleth the sun and the moon to serve you? Each of those luminaries hasteneth in its course to a determined period: And God is well-acquainted with that which ye do.
This is declared concerning the divine knowledge and power, for that God is the true being, and for that whatever ye invoke, besides him, is vanity; and for that God is the high, the great God.
Dost thou not see that the ships run in the sea, through the favour of God, that he may shew you of his signs? Verily herein are signs, unto every patient, grateful person.
When waves cover them, like overshadowing clouds, they call upon God, exhibiting the pure religion unto him; but when He bringeth them safe to land, there is of them who halteth between the true faith and idolatry.
O men, fear your Lord, and dread the day whereon a father shall not make satisfaction for his son, neither shall a son make satisfaction for his father at all: The promise of God is assuredly true. Let not this present life, therefore, deceive you; neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning God.
Verily the knowledge of the hour of judgement is with God: And He causeth the rain to descend, at his own appointed time; and He knoweth what is in the wombs of females. No soul knoweth what it shall gain on the morrow; neither doth any soul know in what land it shall die: But God is knowing and fully acquainted with all things.
