Afterwards We gave you the victory over them, in your turn, and We granted you increase of wealth and children, and We made you a more numerous people, saying,
if ye do well, ye will do well to your own souls; and if ye do evil, ye will do it unto the same. And when the punishment threatened for your latter transgression came to be executed, We sent enemies against you to afflict you, and to enter the temple, as they entered it the first time, and utterly to destroy that which they had conquered.
Peradventure your Lord will have mercy on you hereafter: But if ye return to transgress a third time, We also will return to chastise you; and We have appointed hell to be the prison of the unbelievers.

We have ordained the night and the day for two signs of our power: Afterwards We blot out the sign of the night, and We cause the sign of the day to shine forth, that ye may endeavour to obtain plenty from your Lord by doing your business therein, and that ye may know the number of years, and the computation of time; and every thing necessary have We explained by a perspicuous explication.
The fate of every man have we bound about his neck; and we will produce unto him, on the day of resurrection, a book wherein his actions shall be recorded:
It shall be offered him open, and the angels shall say unto him, read thy book; thine own soul will be a sufficient accountant against thee, this day.
He who shall be rightly directed, shall be directed to the advantage only of his own soul; and he who shall err, shall err only against the same: Neither shall any laden soul be charged with the burden of another. We did not punish any people, until we had first sent an Apostle to warn them.
And when We resolved to destroy a city, We commanded the inhabitants thereof, who lived in affluence, to obey our Apostle; but they acted corruptly herein: Wherefore the sentence was justly pronounced against that city; and We destroyed it with an utter destruction.

Whosoever chooseth this transitory life, We will bestow on him therein before hand that which We please; on him, namely, whom We please: Afterwards will We appoint him hell for his abode; he shall be thrown into the same to be scorched, covered with ignominy, and utterly rejected from mercy.
But whosoever chooseth the life to come, and directeth his endeavour towards the same, being also a true believer; the endeavour of these shall be acceptable unto God.
On all will We bestow the blessings of this life, both on these and on those, of the gift of thy Lord; for the gift of thy Lord shall not be denied unto any.
Behold, how We have caused some of them to surpass others in wealth and dignity: But the next life shall be more considerable in degrees of honour, and greater in excellence.
Set not up another god with the true God, lest thou sit down in disgrace, and destitute.
Thy Lord hath commanded that ye worship none, besides Him; and that ye shew kindness unto your parents, whether the one of them, or both of them attain to old age with thee. Wherefore say not unto them, fie on you! Neither reproach them, but speak respectfully unto them;
and submit to behave humbly towards them, out of tender affection, and say, O Lord, have mercy on them both, as they nursed me when I was little.
Your Lord well knoweth that which is in your souls; whether ye be men of integrity: And He will be gracious unto those who sincerely return unto Him.

Verily thy Lord will inlarge the store of whom He pleaseth, and will be sparing unto whom He pleaseth; for He knoweth and regardeth his servants.
Kill not your children for fear of being brought to want; We will provide for them and for you: Verily the killing them is a great sin.
Draw not near unto fornication; for it is wickedness, and an evil way.
Neither slay the soul which God hath forbidden you to slay, unless for a just cause; and whosoever shall be slain unjustly, We have given his heir power to demand satisfaction; but let him not exceed the bounds of moderation in putting to death the murderer in too cruel a manner, or by revenging his friend's blood on any other than the person who killed him; since he is assisted by this law.
And meddle not with the substance of the orphan, unless it be to improve it, until he attain his age of strength: And perform your covenant; for the performance of your covenant shall be inquired into hereafter.
And give full measure, when you measure ought; and weigh with a just balance. This will be better, and more easy for determining every man's due.
And follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge; for the hearing, and the sight, and the heart, every of these shall be examined at the last day.

Hath your Lord preferably granted unto you sons, and taken for himself daughters from among the angels? Verily in asserting this ye utter a grievous saying.

God forbid! And far, very far, be that from Him which they utter!
The seven heavens praise Him, and the earth, and all who are therein: Neither is there any thing which doth not celebrate his praise; but ye understand not their celebration thereof: He is gracious and merciful.
When thou readest the Koran, We place between thee and those who believe not in the life to come, a dark vail;

They also say, after we shall have become bones and dust, shall we surely be raised a new creature?
Answer, be ye stones, or iron,
or some creature more improbable in your opinions to be raised to life. But they will say, who shall restore us to life? Answer, He who created you the first time: And they will wag their heads at thee, saying, when shall this be? Answer, peradventure it is nigh.

Say, call upon those whom ye imagine to be gods besides Him; yet they will not be able to free you from harm, or to turn it on others.
Those whom ye invoke, do themselves desire to be admitted to a near conjunction with their Lord; striving which of them shall approach nearest unto Him: They also hope for his mercy, and dread his punishment; for the punishment of thy Lord is terrible.
There is no city but We will destroy the same before the day of resurrection, or We will punish it with a grievous punishment. This is written in the book of our eternal decrees.
Nothing hindered us from sending thee with miracles, except that the former nations have charged them with imposture.

Remember when We said unto thee, verily thy Lord encompasseth men by his knowledge and power.

an ample reward for your demerits!

As to my servants, thou shalt have no power over them; for thy Lord is a sufficient protector of those who trust in Him.
It is your Lord who driveth forward the ships for you in the sea, that ye may seek to enrich your selves of his abundance by commerce; for He is merciful towards you.
When a misfortune befalleth you at sea, the false deities whom ye invoke are forgotten by you, except Him alone: Yet when He bringeth you safe to dry land, ye retire afar off from Him, and return to your idols; for man is ungrateful.
Are ye therefore secure that He will not cause the dry land to swallow you up, or that He will not send against you a whirlwind driving the sands to overwhelm you? Then shall ye find none to protect you.
Or are ye secure that He will not cause you again to commit your selves to the sea another time, and send against you a tempestuous wind, and drown you; for that ye have been ungrateful? Then shall ye find none to defend you against Us, in that distress.

Then would We surely have caused thee to taste the punishment of life, and the punishment of death; and thou shouldest not have found any to protect thee against Us.
The unbelievers had likewise almost caused thee to depart the land, that they might have expelled thee thence: But then should they not have tarried therein after thee, except a little while.

Regularly perform thy prayer at the declension of the sun, at the first darkness of the night, and the prayer of day-break; for the prayer of day-break is born witness unto by the angels.

or thou have a garden of palm-trees and vines, and thou cause rivers to spring forth from the midst thereof in abundance;
or thou cause the heaven to fall down upon us, as thou hast given out, in pieces; or thou bring down God and the angels to vouch for thee;
or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend by a ladder to heaven: Neither will we believe thy ascending thither alone, until thou cause a book to descend unto us, bearing witness of thee, which we may read. Answer, my Lord be praised! Am I other than a man, sent as an Apostle?
And nothing hindreth men from believing, when a direction is come unto them, except that they say, hath God sent a man for his Apostle?
Answer, if the angels had walked on earth as familiar inhabitants thereof, We had surely sent down unto them from heaven an angel for our Apostle.
Say, God is a sufficient witness between me and you: For He knoweth and regardeth his servants.

and say, our Lord be praised, for that the promise of our Lord is surely fulfilled!
And they fall down on their faces, weeping; and the hearing thereof increaseth their humility.
Say, call upon God, or call on the Merciful: By which soever of the two names ye invoke Him, it is equal; for He hath most excellent names. Pronounce not thy prayer aloud, neither pronounce it with two low a voice, but follow a middle way between these:
