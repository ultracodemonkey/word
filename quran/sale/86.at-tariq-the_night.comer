By the heaven, and that which appeareth by night:
But what shall cause thee to understand what that which appeareth by night is?
It is the star of piercing brightness:
Every soul hath a guardian set over it.
Let a man consider, therefore, of what he is created.
He is created of seed poured forth,
issuing from the loins, and the breast-bones.
Verily God is able to restore him to life,
the day whereon all secret thoughts and actions shall be examined into;
and he shall have no power to defend himself, nor any protector.
By the heaven which returneth the rain;
and by the earth which openeth to let forth vegetables and springs:
Verily this is a discourse distinguishing good from evil;
and it is not composed with lightness.
Verily the infidels are laying a plot to frustrate my designs:
But I will lay a plot for their ruin.
Wherefore, O prophet, bear with the unbelievers: Let them alone a while.
