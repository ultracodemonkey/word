And when we decreed the death of Solomon, nothing shewed them that he was dead but a reptile of the earth that gnawed the staff which supported his corpse. And when it fell, the Djinn perceived that if they had known the things unseen, they had not continu
A sign there was to SABA, in their dwelling places:-two gardens, the one on the right hand and the other on the left:-"Eat ye of your Lord's supplies, and give thanks to him: Goodly is the country, and gracious is the Lord!"
