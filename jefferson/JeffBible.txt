                                   CHAPTER 1.
  
           Now it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
           decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
           enrolled.
             2 (And this enrollment was the first which was made
           when Quirinius, was governor of Syria.)
             3 And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own
           city.
             4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the
           city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David,
           which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house
           and lineage of David,
             5 To be enrolled with Mary his betrothed, being then
           with child.
             6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the
           days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
             7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and
           wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a
           manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
             8 And when eight days were accomplished for the
           circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS.
             9 And when they had performed all things according to
           the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to
           their own city Nazareth.
             10 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit,
           filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
  
           And when he was twelve years old, they went up to
           Jerusalem, unto the feast according to the custom.
             12 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they
           returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem;
           and his parents knew not of it.
             13 But they, supposing him to have been in the
           company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among
           their kinsfolk and acquaintances.
             14 And when they found him not, they turned back
           again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
             15 And it came to pass, that after three days they
           found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the
           teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
             16 And all that heard him were astonished at his
           understanding and answers.
             17 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his
           mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with
           us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
             18 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth,
           and was subject unto them.
             19 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature.
  
           Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius
           Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and
           Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip
           tetrarch of Ituraea and of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
           tetrarch of Abilene,
             21 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests,
             22 Appeared John the Baptist in the wilderness.
             23 Now the same John had his raiment of camel's hair,
           and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was
           locusts and wild honey.
             24 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea,
           and all the region round about Jordan,
             25 And were baptized of him in Jordan.
  
           Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to
           be baptized of him.
             27 And Jesus himself, when he began his ministry, was
           about thirty years of age.
             28 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his
           mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they
           continued there a few days.
  
           And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
           Jerusalem.
             30 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and
           sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
             31 And when he had made a scourge of cords, he drove
           them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen;
           and poured out the changers' coins, and overthrew their
           tables;
             32 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these
           things hence; make not my Father's house an house of
           merchandise.
             33 After these things came Jesus and his disciples
           into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them,
           and baptized.
  
           Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison,
           he departed into Galilee;
             35 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold
           upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake,
           his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
             36 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for
           thee to have thy brother's wife.
             37 Therefore Herodias had a grudge against him, and
           would have killed him; but she could not:
             38 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just
           man and holy, and protected him; and when he heard him,
           he was sore perplexed, yet he heard him gladly.
             39 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on
           his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains,
           and chief men of Galilee;
             40 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came
           in, and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat with
           him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me
           whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
             41 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask
           of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
             42 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What
           shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
             43 And she came in immediately with haste unto the
           king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me
           straightway in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
             44 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his
           oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he
           would not refuse her.
             45 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and
           commanded his head to be brought: and he went and
           beheaded him in the prison,
             46 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to
           the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
  
           And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the
           sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
             48 And they were astonished at his teaching: for he
           taught them as one that had authority, and not as the
           scribes.
  
           At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the
           corn fields; and his disciples were an hungred, and
           began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.
             50 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him,
           Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do
           upon the sabbath day.
             51 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David
           did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with
           him;
             52 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat
           the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat,
           neither for them which were with him, but only for the
           priests?
             53 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the
           sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the
           sabbath, and are guiltless?
  
           And when he was departed thence, he went into their
           synagogue:
             55 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand
           withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to
           heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
             56 And he said unto them, What man shall there be
           among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall
           into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on
           it, and lift it out?
             57 How much then is a man of more value than a sheep!
           Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days.
             58 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for
           man, and not man for the sabbath.
  
           But the Pharisees went out, and held a council against
           him, how they might destroy him.
             60 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from
           thence: and great multitudes followed him.
  
           And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into
           a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
           God.
             62 And when it was day, he called unto him his
           disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he
           named apostles;
             63 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his
           brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
             64 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and
           Simon called the Zealot,
             65 And Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,
           who became a traitor.
             66 And he came down with them, and stood in the
           plain; and there was a great company of his disciples,
           and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and
           Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon,
           which came to hear him.
  
  
                                   CHAPTER 2.
  
            And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a
            mountain: and when he was set down, his disciples
            came unto him:
              2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
              3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the
            kingdom of heaven.
              4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be
            comforted.
              5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the
            earth.
              6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
            righteousness: for they shall be filled.
              7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain
            mercy.
              8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see
            God.
              9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be
            called the children of God.
              10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for
            righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of
            heaven.
              11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and
            persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against
            you falsely, for my sake.
              12 Rejoice, and be glad: for great is your reward in
            heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were
            before you.
              13 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have
            received your consolation.
              14 Woe unto you that are full now, for ye shall
            hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn
            and weep.
              15 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of
            you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
  
            Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost
            its savour, wherewith shall it again be salted? it is
            thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and
            to be trodden under foot by men.
              17 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set
            on an hill cannot be hid.
              18 Neither do men light a lamp and put it under a
            bushel, but on a lampstand; and it giveth light unto
            all that are in the house.
              19 Let your light so shine before men, that they may
            see your good works, and glorify your Father which is
            in heaven.
  
            Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
            prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
              21 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
            pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from
            the law, till all be fulfilled.
              22 Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least
            of these commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall
            be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but
            whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be
            called great in the kingdom of heaven.
              23 For I say unto you, That except your
            righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
            scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into
            the kingdom of heaven.
  
            Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time,
            Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be
            in danger of judgment:
              25 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with
            his brother shall be in danger of judgment: and
            whosoever shall abuse his brother, shall be in danger
            of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool,
            shall be in danger of hell fire.
              26 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar,
            and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought
            against thee;
              27 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy
            way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come
            and offer thy gift.
              28 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou
            art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary
            deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee
            to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
              29 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means
            come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
            farthing.
  
            Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit
            adultery:
              31 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a
            woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with
            her already in his heart.
              32 And if thy right eye causeth thee to offend,
            pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is
            profitable for thee that one of thy members should
            perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into
            hell.
              33 And if thy right hand causeth thee to offend, cut
            it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for
            thee that one of thy members should perish, and not
            that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
              34 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his
            wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
              35 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away
            his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth
            her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her
            that is divorced committeth adultery.
  
            Again, ye have heard that it hath been said to them of
            old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt
            perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
              37 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by
            heaven; for it is God's throne:
              38 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool:
            neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great
            King.
              39 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because
            thou canst not make one hair white or black.
              40 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay,
            nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
  
            Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an
            eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
              42 But I say unto you, That ye resist not him that
            is evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
            cheek, turn to him the other also.
              43 And if any man will sue thee, and take away thy
            coat, let him have thy cloak also.
              44 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go
            with him twain.
              45 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that
            would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
  
            Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love
            thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
              47 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, pray for
            them that persecute you;
              48 That ye may be the children of your Father which
            is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil
            and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
            the unjust.
              49 For if ye love them which love you, what reward
            have ye? do not even the tax-gatherers the same?
              50 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye
            more than others? do not even the Gentiles so?
              51 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to
            receive, what gain have ye? for sinners also lend to
            sinners, to receive as much again.
              52 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend,
            hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be
            great, and ye shall be the children of the Most High:
            for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.
              53 Be ye merciful, as your Father also is merciful.                       
  
  
                                   CHAPTER 3.
  
           Take heed that ye do not your good works before men,
           to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of
           your Father which is in heaven.
             2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound
           a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the
           synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory
           of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
             3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand
           know what thy right hand doeth:
             4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father
           which seeth in secret shall reward thee.
  
           And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the
           hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the
           synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they
           may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have
           their reward.
             6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy inner
           chamber, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy
           Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in
           secret shall reward thee.
             7 And when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the
           heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for
           their much speaking.
             8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father
           knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
             9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father
           which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
             10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it
           is in heaven.
             11 Give us this day our daily bread.
             12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
           debtors.
             13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
           from evil.
             14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
           heavenly Father will also forgive you:
             15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,
           neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
  
           Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a
           sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that
           they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you,
           They have their reward.
             17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head,
           and wash thy face;
             18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto
           thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which
           seeth in secret, shall reward thee.
  
           Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where
           moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break
           through and steal:
             20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
           where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where
           thieves do not break through nor steal:
             21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart
           be also.
             22 The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore
           thine eye be sound, thy whole body shall be full of
           light.
             23 But if thine eye be not sound, thy whole body
           shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that
           is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
  
           No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate
           the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the
           one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
           riches.
             25 Therefore I say unto you, Be not concerned for
           your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
           nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the
           life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
             26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not,
           neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
           heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not of much more
           value than they?
             27 Which of you by being concerned can add one hour
           to his life?
             28 And why are ye concerned for raiment? Consider the
           lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
           neither do they spin:
             29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all
           his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
             30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the
           field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the
           oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little
           faith?
             31 Therefore be not concerned, saying, What shall we
           eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we
           be clothed?
             32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)
           for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of
           all these things.
             33 But seek ye first his kingdom, and his
           righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto
           you.
             34 Have therefore no concern for the morrow: for the
           morrow shall have concern for the things of itself.
           Sufficient unto the day is the trouble thereof.
           Judge not, that ye be not judged.
             36 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be
           judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be
           measured to you again.
             37 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good
           measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running
           over, shall men give into your bosom   .38 And why
           beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
           but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
             39 Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Let me pull
           out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in
           thine own eye?
             40 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of
           thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast
           out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
  
           Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast
           ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them
           under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
             42 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
           find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
             43 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
           seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be
           opened.
             44 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask
           bread, will he give him a stone?
             45 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
             46 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good
           gifts unto your children, how much more shall your
           Father which is in heaven give good things to them that
           ask him?
             47 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men
           should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the
           law and the prophets.
  
           Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate,
           and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and
           many there be which go in thereat:
             49 But strait is the gate, and narrow is the way,
           which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
  
           Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
           clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
             51 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather
           grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
             52 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit;
           but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
             53 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither
           can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
             54 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is
           hewn down, and cast into the fire.
             55 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
             56 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart
           bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the
           evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
             57 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men
           shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day
           of judgment.
             58 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by
           thy words thou shalt be condemned.
  
           Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and
           doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, which
           built his house upon a rock:
             60 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and
           the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell
           not: for it was founded upon a rock.
             61 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine,
           and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man,
           which built his house upon the sand:
             62 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and
           the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell:
           and great was the fall of it.
             63 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these
           sayings, the people were astonished at his teaching:
             64 For he taught them as one having authority, and
           not as their scribes.
   
  
                                   CHAPTER 4.
  
            When he was come down from the mountain, great
            multitudes followed him.
             2 And he went round about the villages, teaching.
  
           Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
           and I will give you rest.
             4 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am
           meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto
           your souls.
             5 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
             6 Now one of the Pharisees desired him that he would
           eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and
           sat down to meat.
             7 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a
           sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
           Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of ointment,
             8 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began
           to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the
           hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed
           them with the ointment.
             9 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it,
           he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a
           prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman
           this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
             10 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have
           somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.
             11 There was a certain creditor which had two
           debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the
           other fifty.
             12 And when they had nothing to pay, he graciously
           forgave them both. Which of them, therefore, will love
           him most?
             13 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to
           whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast
           rightly judged.
             14 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,
           Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou
           gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my
           feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of
           her head.
             15 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the
           time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
             16 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this
           woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
             17 There came then his brethren and his mother, and,
           standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
             18 And the multitude sat about him, and they said
           unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without
           seek for thee.
             19 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother,
           and my brethren?
             20 And he looked round about on them which sat about
           him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
             21 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same
           is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
             22 In the mean time, when there were gathered
           together a multitude of many thousands of people,
           insomuch that they trod one upon another, he began to
           say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the
           leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
             23 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be
           revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
             24 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness
           shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have
           whispered in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon
           the housetops.
             25 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of
           them that kill the body, and after that have no more
           that they can do.
             26 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear
           him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into
           hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
             27 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And
           yet not one of them is forgotten before God.
             28 But even the very hairs of your head are all
           numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than
           many sparrows.
             29 And one of the company said unto him, Master,
           speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with
           me.
             30 But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or
           a divider over you?
             31 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of
           all manner of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth
           not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
             32 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The
           ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
             33 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall
           I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
             34 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my
           barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my
           fruits and my goods.
             35 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much
           goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat,
           drink, and be merry.
             36 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy
           soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those
           things be, which thou hast provided?
             37 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and
           is not rich toward God.
             38 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say
           unto you, Be not concerned for your life, what ye shall
           eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on.
             39 The life is more than meat, and the body is more
           than raiment.
             40 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor
           reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and yet
           God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the
           fowls!
             41 And which of you with being concerned can add to
           his stature one cubit?
             42 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is
           least, why are ye concerned for the rest?
             43 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not,
           they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon
           in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
             44 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day
           in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how
           much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?
             45And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
           drink, neither be ye of a concerned mind.
             46 For all these things do the nations of the world
           seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of
           these things.
             47 But rather seek ye his kingdom; and these things
           shall be added unto you also.
             48 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's
           good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
             49 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide
           yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the
           heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth,
           neither moth destroyeth.
             50 For where your treasure is, there will your heart
           be also.
             51 Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps
           burning;
             52 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for
           their lord, when he will return from the wedding feast;
           that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him
           immediately.
             53 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he
           cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that
           he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to
           meat, and will come forth and serve them.
             54 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come
           in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those
           servants.
             55 And this know, that if the goodman of the house
           had known what hour the thief would come, he would not
           have suffered his house to be broken through into.
             56 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man
           cometh at an hour when ye think not.
             57 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this
           parable unto us, or also unto all?
             58 And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and
           wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his
           household, to give them their portion of meat in due
           season?
             59 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he
           cometh shall find so doing.
             60 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him
           ruler over all that he hath.
             61 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord
           delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the
           menservants and maidservants, and to eat and drink, and
           to be drunken;
             62 The lord of that servant will come in a day when
           he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not
           aware, and will cut him in sunder.
             63 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and
           prepared not himself, neither did according to his will,
           shall be beaten with many stripes.
             64 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy
           of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto
           whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required:
           and to whom men have committed much, of him they will
           ask the more.
             65 And he said also to the people, When ye see a
           cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There
           cometh a shower; and so it is.
             66 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There
           will be heat; and it cometh to pass.
             67 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky
           and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern
           this present time?
             68 And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is
           right?
             69 While thou goest with thine adversary to the
           magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that
           thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to
           the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer,
           and the officer cast thee into prison.
             70 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till
           thou hast paid the very last mite.
  
    
                                   CHAPTER 5.
  
           There were present at that season some that told him
           of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled
           with their sacrifices.
             2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that
           these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans,
           because they suffered such things?
             3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall
           all likewise perish.
             4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam
           fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners
           above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
             5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall
           all likewise perish.
             6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig
           tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought
           fruit thereon, and found none.
             7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard,
           Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this
           fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it
           the ground?
             8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone
           this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:
             9 And if it bear fruit, well: but if not, then thou
           shalt cut it down.
  
           And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine
           with him: and he went in, and sat down at meat.
             11 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he
           had not first washed before dinner.
             12 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees
           make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but
           your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
             13 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is
           without make that which is within also?
             14 But give alms of such things as ye have; and,
           behold, all things are clean unto you.
             15 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and
           rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over justice and
           the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to
           leave the other undone.
             16 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost
           seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
             17 Woe unto you! for ye are as graves which are not
           seen, and the men that walk over them are not aware of
           them.
             18 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto
           him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.
             19 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye
           lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye
           yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your
           fingers.
             20 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the
           key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them
           that were entering in ye hindered.
             21 And as he departed from thence, the scribes and
           the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to
           provoke him to speak of many things:
             22 Laying wait for him, to catch him in some saying.
           On that same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by
           the sea side.
             24 And great multitudes were gathered together unto
           him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole
           multitude stood on the shore.
             25 And he spake many things unto them in parables,
           saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
             26 And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side,
           and the fowls came and devoured them up:
             27 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not
           much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they
           had no deepness of earth:
             28 But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and
           because they had no root, they withered away.
             29 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung
           up, and choked them:
             30 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth
           fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some
           thirtyfold.
             31 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
             32 And when he was alone, they that were about him
           with the twelve asked of him the parable.
  
           Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
             34 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
           understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and
           snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is
           he which received seed by the way side.
             35 But he that received the seed into stony places,
           the same is he that heareth the word, and at once with
           joy receiveth it;
             36 Yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for
           a while: and when tribulation or persecution ariseth
           because of the word, he quickly falleth away.
             37 He also that received seed among the thorns is he
           that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and
           the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and it
           becometh unfruitful.
             38 But he that received seed into the good ground is
           he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; he also
           beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold,
           some sixty, some thirty.
  
           And he said unto them, Is a lamp brought to be put under
           a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a
           lampstand?
             40 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be
           manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that
           it should come to light.
             41 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
  
           Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The
           kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good
           seed in his field:
             43 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed
           tares among the wheat, and went his way.
             44 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought
           forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
             45 And the servants of the householder came and said
           unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy
           field? from whence then hath it tares?
             46 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The
           servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and
           gather them up?
             47 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the
           tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
             48 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in
           the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye
           together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to
           burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
  
           Then he departed from the multitude, and went into the
           house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare
           unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
             50 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the
           good seed is the Son of man;
             51 The field is the world; the good seed are the
           children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children
           of the wicked one;
             52 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the
           harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are the
           angels.
             53 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in
           the fire; so shall it be in the end of the age.
             54 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and
           they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that
           cause men to sin, and all them which do iniquity;
             55 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:
           there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
             56 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in
           the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let
           him hear.
  
           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid
           in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth,
           and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath,
           and buyeth that field.
             58 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
           merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
             59 Who, when he had found one pearl of great value,
           went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
  
           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that
           was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind:
             61 Which, when it was full, they drew it to shore,
           and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but
           cast the bad away.
             62 So shall it be at the end of the age: the angels
           shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the
           just,
             63 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:
           there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
             64 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all
           these things? They say unto him, Yea.
             65 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe
           which is instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is
           like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth
           forth out of his treasure things new and old.
             66 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man
           should cast seed upon the ground;
             67 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the
           seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
             68 The earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first
           the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the
           ear.
             69 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately
           he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
  
           And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of
           God? or with what parable shall we describe it?
             71 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it
           is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be
           in the earth:
             72 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh
           greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches;
           so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow
           of it.
             73 And with many such parables spake he the word unto
           them, as they were able to hear it.
             74 And without a parable spake he not unto them: but
           when they were alone, he expounded all things to his
           disciples.
  
   
                                   CHAPTER 6.
  
           And as they went in the way, a certain man said unto
           him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
             2 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and
           birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not
           where to lay his head.
             3 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said,
           Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
             4 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead:
           but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
             5 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee;
           but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at my
           house.
             6 But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his
           hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the
           kingdom of God.
  
           And after these things he went forth, and saw a
           publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom:
           and he said unto him, Follow me.
             8 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
             9 And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and
           there was a great company of publicans and
             10 Many publicans and sinners sat also together with
           Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they
           followed him.
             11 And when the scribes which were Pharisees saw him
           eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his
           disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with
           publicans and sinners?
             12 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that
           are whole have no need of the physician, but they that
           are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
             13 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man
           teareth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon
           an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent,
           and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not
           with the old.
             14 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else
           the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and
           the bottles shall perish.
             15 But new wine must be put into new bottles.
  
           And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
           parables, he departed thence.
             17 And when he was come into his own country, he
           taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were
           astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom,
           and these mighty works?
             18 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother
           called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and
           Simon, and Judas?
             19 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence
           then hath this man all these things?
             20 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto
           them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own
           country, and in his own house.
  
           But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with
           compassion on them, because they were distressed, and
           downcast, as sheep having no shepherd.
             22 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to
           send them forth by two and two;
             23 And charged them, saying, Go not into the way of
           the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter
           ye not:
             24 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of
           Israel.
             25 Take ye neither gold, nor silver, nor copper in
           your purses,
             26 Nor bag for your journey, neither two coats,
           neither shoes, nor yet a staff: for the workman is
           worthy of his meat.
             27 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter,
           enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go
           thence.
             28 And when ye come into an house, salute it.
             29 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come
           upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return
           to you.
             30 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your
           words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake
           off the dust of your feet.
             31 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
           for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of
           judgment, than for that city.
  
           Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of
           wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and innocent
           as doves.
             33 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to
           the councils, and they will scourge you in their
           synagogues;
             34 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings
           for my sake, to bear testimony before them and the
           Gentiles.
             35 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye
           into another:
             36 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing
           covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall
           not be known.
             37 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in
           light: and what ye hear whispered in the ear, that
           proclaim ye upon the housetops.
             38 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not
           able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able
           to destroy both soul and body in hell.
             39 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one
           of them shall not fall on the ground without the will of
           your Father.
             40 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
             41 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than
           many sparrows.
             42 And they went out, and preached that men should
           repent.
             43 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto
           Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done,
           and what they had taught.
  
           After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would
           not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
             45 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and
           certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
             46 And they saw some of his disciples eat bread with
           defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands.
             47 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they
           wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of
           the elders.
             48 And when they come from the market, except they
           wash, they eat not. And many other things there be,
           which they have received to hold, as the washing of
           cups, and pitchers, and copper vessels.
             49 And the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk
           not thy disciples according to the tradition of the
           elders, but eat bread with defiled hands?
             50 And when he had called all the people unto him, he
           said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and
           understand:
             51 There is nothing from without a man, that entering
           into him can defile him: but the things which come out
           of him, those are they that defile the man.
  
           And when he was entered into the house from the people,
           his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
             53 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without
           understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever
           thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot
           defile him;
             54 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into
           the belly, and goeth out into the waste? (Thus declared
           he all meats clean.)
             55 And he said, That which cometh out of the man,
           that defileth the man.
             56 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed
           evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders,
           adulteries,
             57 Covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness,
           envy, slander, pride, foolishness:
             58 All these evil things come from within, and defile
           the man.
             59 And from thence he arose, and went into the region
           of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would
           have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
   
  
                                   CHAPTER 7.
  
           At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus,
           saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of
           heaven?
             2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set
           him in the midst of them,
             3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be
           converted, and become as little children, ye shall not
           enter into the kingdom of heaven.
             4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this
           little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of
           heaven.
  
           Woe unto the world because of its stumbling blocks! for
           it must needs be that stumbling blocks come; but woe to
           that man by whom the stumbling block cometh!
             6 And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to
           stumble, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is
           better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
           rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into
           everlasting fire.
             7 And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it
           out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to
           enter into life with one eye, rather than having two
           eyes to be cast into hell fire.
  
           How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of
           them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and
           nine upon the mountains, and goeth and seeketh that
           which is gone astray?
             9 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto
           you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety
           and nine which went not astray.
             10 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is
           in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
  
           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go
           and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he
           shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
             12 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee
           one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three
           witnesses every word may be established.
             13 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto
           the church: but if he neglect even to hear the church,
           let him be unto thee as a Gentile man and a publican.
  
           Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
           brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven
           times?
             15 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until
           seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
  
           Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a
           certain king, which would settle accounts with his
           servants.
             17 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought
           unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
             18 But forasmuch as he had not wherewith to pay, his
           lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and
           children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
             19 The servant therefore fell down, and bowed before
           him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay
           thee all.
             20 Then the lord of that servant was moved with
           compassion, and released him, and forgave him the debt.
             21 But the same servant went out, and found one of
           his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred denarii:
           and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat,
           saying, Pay me that thou owest.
             22 So his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and
           besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will
           pay thee all.
             23 And he would not: but went and cast him into
           prison, till he should pay the debt.
             24 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they
           were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all
           that was done.
             25 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said
           unto him, Thou wicked servant! I forgave thee all that
           debt, because thou didst beseech me:
             26 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
           fellowservant, even as I had mercy on thee?
             27 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the
           tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto
           him.
             28 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto
           you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his
           brother.
  
           After these things the Lord appointed other seventy
           also, and sent them two and two before his face into
           every city and place, whither he himself would come.
             30 And he said unto them, The harvest is great, but
           the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the
           harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his
           harvest.
             31 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs
           among wolves.
             32 Carry neither purse, nor bag, nor shoes: and
           salute no man by the way.
             33 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say,
           Peace be to this house.
             34 And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall
           rest upon him: if not, it shall turn to you again.
             35 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking
           such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of
           his hire. Go not from house to house.
             36 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they
           receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
             37 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they
           receive you not, go ye into the streets of the same, and
           say,
             38 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth to
           our feet, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be
           ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh
           unto you.
             39 But I say unto you, that it shall be more
           tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
  
           Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.
             41 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart
           hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may
           see the works that thou doest.
             42 For no man doeth any thing in secret, if he
           himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these
           things, shew thyself to the world.
             43 For even his brethren did not believe in him.
             44 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet
           come: but your time is alway at hand.
             45 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth,
           because I testify of it, that the works thereof are
           evil.
             46 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up unto this
           feast: for my time is not yet full come.
  
           When he had said these words unto them, he abode still
           in Galilee.
             48 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he
           also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in
           secret.
             49 Now the Jews sought him at the feast, and said,
           Where is he?
             50 And there was much murmuring among the people
           concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others
           said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
             51 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the
           Jews.
             52 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up
           into the temple, and taught.
             53 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How hath this man
           received learning, having never studied?
             54 Jesus answered them, and said,
             55 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of
           you keepeth the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?
             56 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil:
           who seeketh to kill thee?
             57 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one
           work, and ye all marvel.
             58 Moses gave unto you circumcision; (not because it
           is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath
           do circumcise a man.
             59 If a man on the sabbath receive circumcision, that
           the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at
           me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the
           sabbath day?
             60 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge
           with righteous judgment.
  
           Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he,
           whom they seek to kill?
             62 And, lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing
           unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the
           Christ?
             63 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such
           things concerning him; and the chief priests and the
           Pharisees sent officers to seize him.
             64 So there was a division among the people because
           of him.
             65 And some of them would have seized him; but no man
           laid hands on him.
             66 Then came the officers to the chief priests and
           Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not
           brought him?
             67 The officers answered, Never man spake like this
           man.
             68 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also
           deceived?
             69 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees
           believed in him?
             70 But this people who knoweth not the law are
           accursed.
             71 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus
           beforetime, being one of them,)
             72 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him,
           and know what he doeth?
             73 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of
           Galilee? Search, and thou shalt find that out of Galilee
           ariseth no prophet.
             74 And every man went unto his own house.
  
   
                                   CHAPTER 8.
  
            Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
                 2 And early in the morning he came again into the
           temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat
           down, and taught them.
             3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought in a woman
           caught committing adultery; and when they had set her in
           the midst,
             4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was caught
           committing adultery, in the very act.
             5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should
           be stoned: but what sayest thou?
             6 This they said, to test him, that they might have
           cause to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with
           his finger wrote on the ground.
             7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up
           himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin
           among you, let him be the first to cast a stone at her.
             8 And again he stooped down, and with his finger
           wrote on the ground.
             9 And they which heard it, began going out one by
           one, beginning at the eldest: and Jesus was left alone,
           and the woman standing in the midst.
             10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, he said unto
           her, Woman, whither are they gone? hath no man condemned
           thee?
             11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do
           I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
  
           And as he passed by, he saw a man which was blind from
           his birth.
             13 And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who
           did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born
           blind?
             14 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor
           his parents: but that the works of God should be made
           manifest in him.
  
           Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by
           the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other
           way, the same is a thief and a robber.
             16 But he that entereth in by the door is the
           shepherd of the sheep.
             17 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his
           voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth
           them out.
             18 And when he bringeth forth his own sheep, he goeth
           before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his
           voice.
             19 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee
           from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
             20 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth
           down his life for the sheep.
             21 He that is an hireling, and not the shepherd,
           whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and
           leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth
           them, and scattereth them.
             22 He fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth
           not for the sheep.
             23 I am the good shepherd, and know my own, and am
           known of mine.
             24 And other sheep I have, which are not of this
           fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my
           voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
  
           And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and put him to a
           test, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal
           life?
             26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how
           readest thou?
             27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord
           thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
           with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy
           neighbour as thyself.
             28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right:
           this do, and thou shalt live.
             29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto
           Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
             30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down
           from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which
           stripped him of his raiment, and beat him, and departed,
           leaving him half dead.
             31 And by chance there came down a certain priest
           that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other
           side.
             32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place,
           came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
             33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came
           where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on
           him,
             34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring
           in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and
           brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
             35 And on the morrow, he took out two denarii, and
           gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of
           him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come
           again, I will repay thee.
             36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was
           neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?
             37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then
           said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
  
           And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a
           certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said
           unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught
           his disciples.
             39 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father,
           Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
             40 Give us each day our daily bread.
             41 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every
           one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into
           temptation.
             42 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a
           friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto
           him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
             43 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me,
           and I have nothing to set before him?
             44 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble
           me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with
           me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
             45 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give
           him, because he is his friend, yet because of his
           importunity he will rise and give him as many as he
           needeth.
             46 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given
           you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be
           opened unto you.
             47 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
           seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be
           opened.
             48 If a son shall ask a fish, will he for a fish give
           him a serpent?
             49 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a
           scorpion?
             50 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good
           gifts unto your children: how much more shall your
           heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
           him?
  
  
                                   CHAPTER 9.
  
            And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one
           of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath
           day, that they watched him.
             2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him
           which had the dropsy.
             3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and
           Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
           day, or no?
             4 But they held their peace.
             5 And he saith unto them, Which of you shall have a
           son or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway
           pull him out on the sabbath day?
             6 And they could not answer him to these things.
             7 And he put forth a parable to those which were
           bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief
           places; saying unto them.
             8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding feast,
           sit not down in the highest place; lest a more
           honourable man than thou be bidden by him;
             9 And he that bade thee and him shall come and say to
           thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to
           take the lowest place.
             10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the
           lowest place; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may
           say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou
           have honour in the presence of them that sit at meat
           with thee.
             11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased;
           and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
             12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou
           makest a dinner or a feast, call not thy friends, nor
           thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich
           neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a
           recompence be made thee.
             13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the
           maimed, the lame, the blind:
             14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot
           recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the
           resurrection of the just.
           Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great feast,
           and bade many:
             16 And sent his servant at the time of the feasst to
           say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are
           now ready.
             17 And they all with one consent began to make
           excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece
           of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee
           have me excused.
             18 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen,
           and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.
             19 And another said, I have married a wife, and
           therefore I cannot come.
             20 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these
           things. Then the master of the house being angry said to
           his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes
           of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the
           maimed, and the blind, and the halt.
             21 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou
           hast commanded, and yet there is room.
             22 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into
           the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in,
           that my house may be filled.
             23 For I say unto you, None of those men which were
           bidden shall taste of my supper.
           For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth
           not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have
           sufficient to finish it?
             25 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and
           is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to
           mock him,
             26 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able
           to finish.
             27 Or what king, going to make war against another
           king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he
           be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh
           against him with twenty thousand?
             28 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off,
           he sendeth an embassy, and desireth conditions of peace.
  
           Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners
           for to hear him.
             30 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying,
           This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
             31 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
             32 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he
           lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in
           the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until
           he find it?
             33 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his
           shoulders, rejoicing.
             34 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his
           friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with
           me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
             35 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in
           heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over
           ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
             36 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if
           she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the
           house, and seek diligently till she find it?
             37 And when she hath found it, she calleth her
           friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice
           with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
             38 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the
           presence of the angels of God over one sinner that
           repenteth.
             39 And he said, A certain man had two sons:
             40 And the younger of them said to his father,
           Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.
           And he divided unto them his living.
             41 And not many days after, the younger son gathered
           all together, and took his journey into a far country,
           and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
             42 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty
           famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
             43 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of
           that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed
           swine.
             44 And he would fain have filled his belly with the
           husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
             45 But when he came to himself, he said, How many
           hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to
           spare, and I perish with hunger!
             46 I will arise and go to my father, and will say
           unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
           before thee,
             47 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make
           me as one of thy hired servants.
             48 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he
           was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had
           compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
           him.
             49 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned
           against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy
           to be called thy son.
             50 But the father said to his servants, Bring
           forthwith the best robe, and put it on him; and put a
           ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
             51 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and
           let us eat, and be merry:
             52 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he
           was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
             53 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came
           and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
             54 And he called one of the servants, and asked what
           these things meant.
             55 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy
           father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath
           received him safe and sound.
             56 But he was angry, and would not go in: therefore
           came his father out, and entreated him.
             57 But he answering said to his father, Lo, these
           many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at
           any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a
           kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
             58 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath
           devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for
           him the fatted calf.
             59 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me,
           and all that I have is thine.
             60 It was meet that we should make merry, and be
           glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again;
           and was lost, and is found.
   
  
                                  CHAPTER 10.
  
            And he said also unto his disciples, There was a
           certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same
           was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
             2 And he called him, and said unto him, What is this
           that I hear of thee? give an account of thy stewardship;
           for thou mayest be no longer steward.
             3 And the steward said within himself, What shall I
           do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I
           have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.
             4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out
           of the stewardship, they may receive me into their
           houses.
             5 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto
           him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto
           my lord?
             6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he
           said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and
           write fifty.
             7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou?
           And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said
           unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
             8 And the lord commended the dishonest steward,
           because he had done wisely: for the children of this
           world are wiser in their dealings with their own
           generation than the children of light.
             9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by
           means of the mammon of this world; that, when it faileth
           you, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
             10 He that is faithful in that which is least is
           faithful also in much: and he that is dishonest in the
           least is dishonest also in much.
             11 If therefore ye have not been faithful with the
           worldly mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
           riches?
             12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is
           another man's, who shall give you that which is your
           own?
             13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he
           will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will
           hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve
           God and mammon.
             14 Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard
           all these things: and they derided him.
             15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify
           yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for
           that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination
           in the sight of God.
  
           Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
           committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is
           put away from her husband committeth adultery.
  
           There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in
           purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
             18 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus,
           which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
             19 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell
           from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and
           licked his sores.
             20And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was
           carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man
           also died, and was buried;
             21 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in
           torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his
           bosom.
             22 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy
           on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
           finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented
           in this flame.
             23 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy
           lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise
           Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted here, and
           thou art tormented.
             24 And beside all this, between us and you there is a
           great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from
           hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that
           would come from thence.
             25 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that
           thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
             26 For I have five brethren; that he may warn them,
           lest they also come into this place of torment.
             27 But Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and
           the prophets; let them hear them.
             28 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went
           unto them from the dead, they will repent.
             29 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and
           the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one
           rose from the dead.
  
           Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but
           that occasions of stumbling will come: but woe unto him,
           through whom they come!
             31 It were better for him that a millstone were
           hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than
           that he should cause one of these little ones to
           stumble.
             32 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother sin,
           rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
             33 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a
           day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee,
           saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
             34 But which of you, having a servant plowing or
           keeping sheep, will say unto him when he is come from
           the field, Go straightway and sit down to meat?
             35 But will not rather say unto him, Make ready
           wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me,
           till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt
           eat and drink?
             36 Doth he thank that servant because he did the
           things that were commanded him?
             37 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those
           things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
           servants: we have done only that which was our duty to
           do.
             38 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when
           the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and
           said, The kingdom of God cometh not with signs that are
           observed:
             39 And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be
           also in the days of the Son of man.
             40 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they
           were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered
           into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them
           all.
             41 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they
           did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
           planted, they builded;
             42 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it
           rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed
           them all.
             43 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of
           man is revealed.
             44 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop,
           and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to
           take it away: and he that is in the field, let him
           likewise not return back.
             45 Remember Lot's wife.
             46 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose
           it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
             47 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men
           in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall
           be left.
             48 Two women shall be grinding together; the one
           shall be taken, and the other left.
  
           And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that they
           ought always to pray, and not to faint;
             50 Saying, There was in a certain city a judge, which
           feared not God, neither regarded man:
             51 And there was a widow in that city; and she came
           unto him, saying, Render justice for me against mine
           adversary.
             52 And he would not for a while: but afterward he
           said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard
           man;
             53 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will render
           her justice, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
             54 And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge
           saith.
             55 And shall not God render justice for his own
           elect, which cry day and night unto him? Shall he delay
           long over them?
             56 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.
           Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find
           faith on the earth?
             57 And he spake this parable unto certain which
           trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and
           despised others:
             58 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a
           Pharisee, and the other a publican.
             59 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself,
           God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,
           extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
           publican.
             60 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all
           that I gain.
             61 And the publican, standing afar off, would not
           lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon
           his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
             62 I tell you, this man went down to his house
           justified rather than the other: for every one that
           exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth
           himself shall be exalted.
  
           Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into
           a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha
           received him into her house.
             64 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat
           at the Lord's feet, and heard his word.
             65 But Martha was busy about much serving, and came
           to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my
           sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore
           that she help me.
             66 But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha,
           Martha, thou art concerned and troubled about many
           things:
             67 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen
           that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
  
   
                                  CHAPTER 11.
  
           And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished
           these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came
           into the region of Judaea beyond Jordan;
             2 And great multitudes followed him.
             3 The Pharisees also came unto him, testing him, and
           saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his
           wife for any cause?
             4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not
           read, that he which made them at the beginning made them
           male and female,
             5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father
           and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain
           shall be one flesh?
             6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh.
           What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
           asunder.
             7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to
           give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
             8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness
           of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but
           from the beginning it was not so.
             9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his
           wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry
           another, committeth adultery.
  
           The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so
           with his wife, it is not good to marry.
             11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this
           saying, save they to whom it is given.
             12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born
           from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs,
           which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs,
           which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
           heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him
           receive it.
  
           Then were there brought unto him little children, that
           he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the
           disciples rebuked them.
             14 But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and
           forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth
           the kingdom of heaven.
             15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed
           thence.
  
           And, behold, one came and said unto him, Master, what
           good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
             17 And he said unto him, Wherefore asketh thou me
           concerning that which is good? there is none good but
           one; but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
           commandments.
             18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt
           do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
           not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
             19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt
           love thy neighbour as thyself.
             20 The young man saith unto him, All these things
           have I kept: what lack I yet?
             21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go
           and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
           shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
             22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went
           away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
  
           Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto
           you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom
           of heaven.
             24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel
           to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man
           to enter into the kingdom of God.
             25 When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly
           amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
             26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With
           men this is impossible; but with God all things are
           possible.
           For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
           householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
           labourers for his vineyard.
             28 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a
           denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
             29 And he went out about the third hour, and saw
           others standing idle in the marketplace,
             30 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard,
           and whatsoever is right I will give you. So they went
           also.
             31 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour,
           and did likewise.
             32 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found
           others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye
           here all the day idle?
             33 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us.
           He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.
             34 And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard
           saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give
           them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
             35 And when they came that were hired about the
           eleventh hour, they received every man a denarius.
             36 And when the first came, they supposed that they
           should receive more; but they likewise received every
           man a denarius.
             37 And when they had received it, they murmured
           against the goodman of the house,
             38 Saying, These last have laboured but one hour, and
           thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the
           burden and heat of the day.
             39 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I
           do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a
           denarius?
             40 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give
           unto this last, even as unto thee.
             41 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with
           mine own? Or is thine eye envious, because I give
           freely?
             42 So the last shall be first, and the first last.
  
           And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
             44 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus,
           which was the chief among the publicans, and he was
           rich.
             45 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could
           not for the press, because he was little of stature.
             46 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore
           tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.
             47 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up,
           and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down;
           for to day I must abide at thy house.
             48 And he made haste, and came down, and received him
           joyfully.
             49 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying,
           He is gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
             50 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord:
           Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor;
           and if I have taken any thing from any man by false
           accusation, I restore him fourfold.
             51 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation
           come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of
           Abraham.
             52 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save
           that which was lost.
  
           And as they heard these things, he continued and spake a
           parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because
           they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately
           appear.
             54 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a
           far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and then
           to return.
             55 And he called ten of his servants, and delivered
           them ten pounds, and said unto them, Do business with
           this till I come.
             56 But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy
           after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign
           over us.
             57 And it came to pass, that when he was returned,
           having received the kingdom, then he commanded these
           servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the
           money, that he might know how much every man had gained
           by trading.
             58 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath
           gained ten pounds more.
             59 And he said unto him, Well done, thou good
           servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very
           little, have thou authority over ten cities.
             60 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath
           gained five pounds.
             61 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over
           five cities.
             62 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is
           thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:
             63 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere
           man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and
           reapest that thou didst not sow.
             64 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will
           I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I
           was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and
           reaping that I did not sow:
             65 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the
           bank, that at my coming I might have received it with
           interest?
             66 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him
           the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.
             67 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten
           pounds!)
             68 I say unto you, That unto every one which hath
           shall more be given; from him that hath not, even that
           which he hath shall be taken away.
             69 But those mine enemies, which would not that I
           should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them
           before me.
             70 And when he had thus spoken, he went before,
           ascending up to Jerusalem.
  
      
                                  CHAPTER 12.
  
            And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come
            to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent
           Jesus two disciples,
             2 Saying unto them, Go into the village which is
           before you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied,
           and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.
             3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say,
           The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send
           them.
             4 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded
           them,
             5 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them
           their clothes, and he sat thereon.
             6 And a very great multitude spread their garments in
           the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and
           strewed them in the way.
             7 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city
           was moved, saying, Who is this?
             8 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves,
           Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is
           gone after him.
             9 Now there were certain Greeks among them that came
           up to worship at the feast:
             10 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of
           Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we
           would see Jesus.
             11 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and then Andrew
           and Philip tell Jesus.
             12 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come,
           that the Son of man should be glorified.
             13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of
           wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:
           but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
             14 And he left them, and went out of the city into
           Bethany; and he lodged there.
             15 And on the morrow, when they were come from
           Bethany,   16 Jesus went into the temple, and began to
           cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and
           overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats
           of them that sold doves;
             17 And would not suffer that any man should carry any
           goods through the temple.
             18 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not
           written, My house shall be called the house of prayer
           for all nations? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
             19 And the chief priests and scribes heard it, and
           sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him,
           because all the people was astonished at his teaching.
             20 And when even was come, they went out of the city.
  
           And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking
           in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and
           the scribes, and the elders,
             22 And he said unto them, But what think ye? A
           certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and
           said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
             23 And he answered and said, I will not: but
           afterward he repented, and went.
             24 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And
           he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.
             25 Which of the twain did the will of his father?
           They answer, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I
           say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into
           the kingdom of God before you.
  
           Hear another parable:
             27 A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge
           about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built
           a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a
           far country.
             28 And at the harvest season he sent to the
           husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the
           husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
             29 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him
           away empty-handed.
             30 And again he sent unto them another servant; and
           they wounded him in the head, and sent him away
           shamefully handled.
             31 And again he sent another; and him they killed;
           and many others, beating some, and killing some.
             32 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he
           sent him also last unto them, saying, They will
           reverence my son.
             33 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This
           is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance
           shall be our's.
             34 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him
           out of the vineyard.
             35 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do?
           he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give
           the vineyard unto others.
             36 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard
           his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
             37 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they
           feared the multitude, because they took him for a
           prophet.
  
           And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by
           parables, and said,
             39 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king,
           which made a marriage feast for his son,
             40 And sent forth his servants to call them that were
           bidden to the wedding feast: and they would not come.
             41 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell
           them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my
           dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all
           things are ready: come unto the marriage feast.
             42 But they made light of it, and went their ways,
           one to his farm, another to his business:
             43 And the remnant took his servants, and treated
           them shamefully and slew them.
             44 But the king was wroth: and he sent forth his
           armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
           their city.
             45 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is
           ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
             46 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as
           ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.
             47 So those servants went out into the highways, and
           gathered together all as many as they found, both bad
           and good: and the wedding hall was furnished with
           guests.
  
           But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw
           there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
             49 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in
           hither not having a wedding garment? And he was
           speechless.
             50 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand
           and foot, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall
           be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
             51 For many are called, but few are chosen.
  
           Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
           entangle him in his talk.
             53 And they sent out unto him their disciples with
           the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art
           true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither
           deferrest thou to any man: for thou regardest not the
           station of men.
             54 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it
           lawful to pay taxes unto Caesar, or not?
             55 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,
           Why do ye test me, ye hypocrites?
             56 Shew me the tax money. And they brought unto him a
           denarius.
             57 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
           superscription?
             58 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto
           them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are
           Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.
             59 When they had heard these words, they marvelled,
           and left him, and went their way.
  
           The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that
           there is no resurrection, and asked him,
             61 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having
           no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise
           up seed unto his brother.
             62 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the
           first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having
           no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
             63 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the
           seventh.
             64 And last of all the woman died also.
             65 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she
           be of the seven? for they all had her.
             66 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not
           knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
             67 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor
           are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.
             68 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have
           ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God,
           saying,
             69 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
           the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of
           the living.
             70 And when the multitude heard this, they were
           astonished at his teaching.
  
           And one of the scribes came, and having heard them
           reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered
           them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of
           all?
             72 And Jesus answered him, The first is, Hear, O
           Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
             73 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
           heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and
           with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.
             74 The second is thus: Thou shalt love thy neighbour
           as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than
           these.
             75 On these two commandments hang all the law and the
           prophets.
             76 And the scribe said unto him, Thou speakest
           rightly, Master, in that thou hast said, God is one; and
           there is none other but he:
             77 And to love him with all the heart, and with all
           the understanding, and with all the strength, and to
           love thy neighbour as thyself, is more than all whole
           burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
  
    
                                  CHAPTER 13.
  
           Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his
           disciples,
             2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses'
           seat:
             3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that
           observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for
           they say, and do not accordingly.
             4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be
           borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they
           themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
             5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men:
           they make broad their phylacteries, and lengthen the
           fringes of their garments,
             6 And love the place of honour at feasts, and the
           chief seats in the synagogues,
             7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of
           men, Rabbi.
             8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master,
           and all ye are brethren.
             9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one
           is your Father, which is in heaven.
             10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your
           Master, even Christ.
             11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your
           servant.
             12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be
           humbled; and he that shall humble himself shall be
           exalted.
  
           But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for
           ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men:
             14 For ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye
           them that are entering to go in.
             15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
           for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and
           when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of
           hell than yourselves.
             16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say,
           Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but
           whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is
           bound thereby!
             17 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the
           gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
             18 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is
           nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon
           it, he is bound thereby.
             19 Ye blind men: for whether is greater, the gift, or
           the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
             20 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth
           by it, and by all things thereon.
             21 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by
           it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
             22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the
           throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
             23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
           for ye pay tithe of mint and dill and cummin, and have
           omitted the weightier matters of the law, justice,
           mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, without
           leaving the other undone.
             24 Ye blind guides, which strain out a gnat, and
           swallow a camel.
             25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
           for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the
           platter, but within they are full of extortion and
           excess.
             26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is
           within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may
           be clean also.
             27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
           for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed
           appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead
           men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
             28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto
           men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
             29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
           because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish
           the sepulchres of the righteous,
             30 And say, If we had been in the days of our
           fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in
           the blood of the prophets.
             31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye
           are the children of them which killed the prophets.
             32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
             33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye
           escape the condemnation of hell?
  
           And Jesus sat opposite the treasury, and beheld how the
           people cast money into the treasury: and many that were
           rich cast in much.
             35 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw
           in two mites, which make a penny.
             36 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith
           unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow
           hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into
           the treasury:
             37 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but
           she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all
           her living.
           And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and
           his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings
           of the temple.
             39 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these
           things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left
           here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown
           down.
             40 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the
           mountains:
             41 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to
           take any thing out of his house:
             42 Neither let him which is in the field return back
           to take his cloak.
             43 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them
           that give suck in those days!
             44 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,
           neither on the sabbath day:
             45 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was
           not since the beginning of the world to this time, no,
           nor ever shall be.
             46 Immediately after the tribulation of those days
           shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give
           her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
           powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
  
           Now learn a parable from the fig tree; When its branch
           is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that
           summer is nigh:
             48 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these
           things, know that he is near, even at the doors.
             49 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, not the
           angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.
             50 But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the
           coming of the Son of man be.
             51 For as in the days that were before the flood they
           were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
           marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
             52 And knew not until the flood came, and took them
           all away; so shall the coming of the Son of man be.
             53 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be
           taken, and the other left.
             54 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one
           shall be taken, and the other left.
  
           Watch therefore: for ye know not what day your Lord doth
           come.
             56 But know this, that if the goodman of the house
           had known in what watch the thief would come, he would
           have watched, and would not have suffered his house to
           be broken into.
             57 Therefore be ye also ready.
             58 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his
           lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them
           their meat in due season?
             59 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he
           cometh shall find so doing.
             60 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him
           ruler over all his goods.
             61 But and if that evil servant shall say in his
           heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
             62 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and
           to eat and drink with the drunken;
             63 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when
           he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not
           aware of,
             64 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his
           portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and
           gnashing of teeth.
  
  
                                  CHAPTER 14.
  
           Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
           virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to
           meet the bridegroom.
             2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
             3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took
           no oil with them:
             4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their
           lamps.
             5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered
           and slept.
             6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
           bridegroom! Go ye out to meet him.
             7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their
           lamps.
             8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your
           oil; for our lamps are gone out.
             9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there
           be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them
           that sell, and buy for yourselves.
             10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came;
           and they that were ready went in with him to the
           marriage feast; and the door was shut.
             11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying,
           Lord, Lord, open to us.
             12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I
           know you not.
             13 Watch therefore.
             14 For it shall be like unto a man travelling into a
           far country, who called his own servants, and delivered
           unto them his goods.
             15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two,
           and to another one; to every man according to his
           several ability; and then took his journey.
             16 Straightway he that had received the five talents
           went and traded with the same, and made therewith other
           five talents.
             17 And likewise he that had received two, he also
           gained other two.
             18 But he that had received one went and digged in
           the earth, and hid his lord's money.
             19 After a long time the lord of those servants
           cometh, and reckoneth with them.
             20 And he that had received five talents came and
           brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou
           deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained
           beside them five talents more.
             21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and
           faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few
           things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter
           thou into the joy of thy lord.
             22 He also that had received two talents came and
           said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents:
           behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
             23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and
           faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few
           things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter
           thou into the joy of thy lord.
             24 Then he which had received the one talent came and
           said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man,
           reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where
           thou hast not strewn:
             25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in
           the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
             26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked
           and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I
           sowed not, and gather where I have not strewn:
             27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to
           the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have
           received mine own with interest.
             28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it
           unto him which hath ten talents.
             29 For unto every one that hath shall more be given,
           and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not
           shall be taken away even that which he hath.
             30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer
           darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
             31 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
           hearts be filled with revellings, and drunkenness, and
           cares of this life, and so that day come upon you
           suddenly like a snare.
             32 For it shall come upon all them that dwell on the
           face of the whole earth.
             33 But watch ye always and pray, that ye may be with
           strength to escape all these things that shall come to
           pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
  
           When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the
           angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of
           his glory:
             35 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and
           he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd
           divideth the sheep from the goats:
             36 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but
           the goats on the left.
             37 Then shall the King say unto them on his right
           hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
           prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
             38 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was
           thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye
           invited me in:
             39 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye
           visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
             40 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord,
           when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty,
           and gave thee drink?
             41 When saw we thee a stranger, and invited thee in?
           or naked, and clothed thee?
             42 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came
           unto thee?
             43 And the King shall answer and say unto them,
           Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
           one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
           unto me.
             44 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand,
           Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
           prepared for the devil and his angels:
             45 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I
           was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
             46 I was a stranger, and ye invited me not in: naked,
           and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye
           visited me not.
             47 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord,
           when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger,
           or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister
           unto thee?
             48 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say
           unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least
           of these, ye did it not to me.
             49 And these shall go away into everlasting
           punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
  
  
                                  CHAPTER 15.
  
           It was now two days until the passover, and the feast
           of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the
           scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put
           him to death.
             2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be
           an uproar of the people.
             3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the
           leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an
           alabaster vial of ointment of spikenard very precious;
           and she brake the vial, and poured it on his head.
             4 But there were some that had indignation within
           themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment
           made?
             5 For it might have been sold for more than three
           hundred denarii, and have been given to the poor. And
           they rebuked her.
             6 But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her?
           she hath wrought a good work on me.
             7 For ye have the poor with you always, and
           whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have
           not always.
             8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand
           to anoint my body for burying.
  
           Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto
           the chief priests,
             10 And said unto them, What will ye give me if I will
           deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty
           pieces of silver.
             11 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray
           him.
  
           Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
           disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt
           thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
             13 And he said, Go into the city to a certain man,
           and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand;
           I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
             14 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them;
           and they made ready the passover.
             15 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the
           twelve.
             16 And there arose also a dispute among them, which
           of them should be accounted the greatest.
             17 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles
           exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise
           authority upon them are called benefactors.
             18 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest
           among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is
           chief, as he that doth serve.
             19 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat,
           or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but
           I am among you as he that serveth.
  
           And while they supped,
             21 Jesus riseth from supper, and laid aside his
           garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
             22 After that he poureth water into a basin, and
           began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with
           the towel wherewith he was girded.
             23 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith
           unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
             24 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou
           knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
             25 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my
           feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast
           no part with me.
             26 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet
           only, but also my hands and my head.
             27 Jesus saith to him, He that has washed needeth not
           save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye
           are clean, but not all.
             28 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said
           he, Ye are not all clean.
             29 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken
           his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them,
           Know ye what I have done to you?
             30 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for
           so I am.
             31 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your
           feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
             32 For I have given you an example, that ye should do
           as I have done to you.
             33 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not
           greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater
           than he that sent him.
             34 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do
           them.
  
           When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
           testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
           that one of you shall betray me.
             36 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting
           of whom he spake.
             37 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his
           disciples, whom Jesus loved.
             38 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him and said,
           Ask him who it should be of whom he spake.
             39 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him,
           Lord, who is it?
             40 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a
           sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the
           sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
  
           Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said,
             42 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love
           one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love
           one another.
             43 By this shall all men know that ye are my
           disciples, if ye have love one to another.
             44 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall fall away
           because of me this night:
             45 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men
           shall fall away because of thee, yet will I never fall
           away.
             46 I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and
           to death.
             47 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall
           not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny
           that thou knowest me.
             48 Peter said unto him, Though I must die with thee,
           yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the
           disciples.
  
           Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called
           Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here,
           while I go and pray yonder.
             50 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of
           Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
             51 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding
           sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch
           with me.
             52 And he went a little farther, and fell on his
           face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible,
           let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will,
           but as thou wilt.
             53 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them
           asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch
           with me one hour?
             54 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation:
           the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
             55 He went away again the second time, and prayed,
           saying, My Father, if this cup may not pass away from
           me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
             56 And he came and found them asleep again: for their
           eyes were heavy.
             57 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed
           the third time, saying the same words.
             58 Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto
           them, Are ye still sleeping, and taking your rest?
  
   
                                 CHAPTER 16.
  
           When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with
           his disciples through the Kidron valley, where was a
           garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
             2 Now Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place:
           for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
             3 Judas then, having received a band of soldiers and
           officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh
           thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
             4 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying,
           Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
             5 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail,
           master; and kissed him.
             6 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, do that for which
           thou art come.
             7 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should
           come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek
           ye?
             8 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith
           unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him,
           stood with them.
             9 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he,
           they drew backward, and fell to the ground.
             10 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they
           said, Jesus of Nazareth.
             11 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if
           therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
             12 Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and seized
           him.
             13 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus
           stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck
           the servant of the high priest, and smote off his ear.
             14 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword
           into its place: for all they that take the sword shall
           perish by the sword.
  
           In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye
           come out as against a thief with swords and staves for
           to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple,
           and ye laid no hold on me.
             16 Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
             17 And there followed him a certain young man, having
           only a linen cloth upon his naked body; and they laid
           hold on him:
             18 But he left the linen cloth, and fled from them
           naked.
  
           And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to
           Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the
           elders were assembled.
             20 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another
           disciple: now that disciple was known unto the high
           priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the
           high priest.
             21 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out
           that other disciple, which was known unto the high
           priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and
           brought in Peter.
             22 And the servants and officers stood there, who had
           made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed
           themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed
           himself.
             23 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto
           Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He
           saith, I am not.
             24 Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They
           said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his
           disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
             25 One of the servants of the high priest, being his
           kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see
           thee in the garden with him?
             26 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock
           crew.
             27 And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said
           unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me
           thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
             28 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples,
           and of his teaching.
             29 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I
           ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither
           the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said
           nothing.
             30 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what
           I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
             31 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers
           which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand,
           saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
             32 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear
           witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
             33 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and
           there were assembled all the chief priests and the
           elders and the scribes.
             34 Now the chief priests and all the council sought
           for witness against Jesus to put him to death; but found
           none.
             35 For many bare false witness against him, but their
           witness agreed not together.
             36 And there arose certain, and bare false witness
           against him, saying,
             37 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that
           is made with hands, and within three days I will build
           another made without hands.
             38 But not even in this regard did their witness
           agree together.
             39 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and
           asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it
           which these witness against thee?
             40 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again
           the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou
           the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
             41 But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not
           believe:
             42 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me.
             43 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God?
           And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
             44 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith,
           What need we any further witnesses?
             45 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And
           they all condemned him to be worthy of death.
             46 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his
           face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy:
           and the guards did strike him with the palms of their
           hands.
  
           Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the Praetorium:
           and it was early; and they themselves went not into the
           hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might
           eat the passover.
             48 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What
           accusation bring ye against this man?
             49 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a
           malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto
           thee.
             50 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge
           him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto
           him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
             51 Then Pilate entered into the Praetorium again, and
           called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of
           the Jews?
             52 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of
           thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
             53 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and
           the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast
           thou done?
             54 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world:
           if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants
           fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but
           now is my kingdom not from hence.
             55 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king
           then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To
           this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the
           world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every
           one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
             56 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he
           had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and
           saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.
             57 But they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth
           up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning
           from Galilee to this place.
             58 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how
           many things they witness against thee?
             59 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the
           man were a Galilean.
             60 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto
           Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself
           also was in Jerusalem at that time.
  
           Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he
           was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had
           heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some
           miracle done by him.
             62 And he questioned with him at great length; but he
           answered him nothing.
             63 And the chief priests and scribes stood by and
           vehemently accused him.
             64 And Herod with his soldiers dealt with him
           contemptuously, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a
           gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
             65 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made
           friends together: for before they were at enmity between
           themselves.
             66 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief
           priests and the rulers and the people,
             67 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me,
           as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I,
           having examined him before you, have found no guilt in
           this man touching the charges whereof ye accuse him:
             68 No, nor yet Herod: for he sent him again to us;
           and, lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
             69 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
    
  
                                  CHAPTER 17.
  
           Now at the feast the governor was wont to release
           unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
             2 And they had then a notable prisoner, called
           Barabbas.
             3 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate
           said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?
           Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
             4 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
  
           Moreover, while he was set down on the judgment seat,
           his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do
           with that just man: for I have suffered many things this
           day in a dream because of him.
             6 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the
           multitude that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy
           Jesus.
             7 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether
           of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said,
           Barabbas.
             8 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with
           Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let
           him be crucified.
             9 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done?
           But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be
           crucified.
  
           Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had
           scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
             11 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into
           the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band of
           soldiers.
             12 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they
           put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and
           they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying,
           Hail, King of the Jews!
             13 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and
           smote him on the head.
             14 And after that they had mocked him, they took the
           robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and
           led him away to crucify him.
  
           Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he
           was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the
           thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
             16 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed
           innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see
           thou to that.
             17 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the
           temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
             18 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and
           said, It is not lawful for to put them into the
           treasury, because it is the price of blood.
             19 And they took counsel, and bought with them the
           potter's field, to bury strangers in.
             20 Wherefore that field is called, The Field of
           Blood, unto this day.
  
           And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon
           of Cyrene, coming out of the country, and on him they
           laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
             22 And there followed him a great company of people,
           and of women, which bewailed and lamented him.
             23 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of
           Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and
           for your children.
             24 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which
           they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs
           that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
             25 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains,
           Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
             26 For if they do these things in a green tree, what
           shall be done in the dry?
             27 And there were also two other, malefactors, led
           with him to be put to death.
  
           And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called
           the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew
           Golgotha:
             29 There they crucified him, and two other with him,
           on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
             30 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross.
           And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE
           JEWS.
             31 This title then read many of the Jews: for the
           place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city:
           and it was written in Hebrew, and Latin, and Greek.
             32 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate,
           Write not, The King of the Jews; but, This man said I am
           King of the Jews.
             33 Pilate answered, What I have written I have
           written.
             34 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus,
           took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier
           a part; and also his undergarment: now the undergarment
           was without seam, woven from the top to the bottom.
             35 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not
           rend it, but cast lots for it, in order to determine
           whose it shall be.
  
           And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their
           heads,
             37 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and
           buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the
           Son of God, come down from the cross.
             38 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with
           the scribes and elders, said,
             39 He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the
           King of Israel: let him now come down from the cross,
           and we will believe in him.
             40 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he
           will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
             41 And one of the malefactors which were hanged
           railed on him, saying, Art thou not the Christ? Save
           thyself and us!
             42 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost
           not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same
           condemnation?
             43 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due
           reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing
           amiss.
             44 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they
           know not what they do.
  
           Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and
           his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clophas, and Mary
           Magdalene.
             46 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the
           disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his
           mother, Woman, behold thy son!
             47 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!
           And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own
           home.
  
           And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
           saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My
           God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
             49 Some of them that stood there, when they heard
           that, said, This man calleth for Elijah.
             50 And straightway one of them ran, and took a
           sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a
           reed, and gave him to drink.
             51 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elijah
           will come to save him.
             52 Jesus, when he had cried out again with a loud
           voice, yielded up the ghost.
             53 And many women were there beholding afar off,
           which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
             54 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
           mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's
           sons.
             55 The Jews therefore, because it was the day of
           preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the
           cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath was an high
           day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,
           and that they might be taken away.
             56 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the
           first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
             57 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was
           dead already, they brake not his legs:
             58 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his
           side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
             59 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a
           disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews,
           besought Pilate that he might take away the body of
           Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and
           took the body of Jesus.
             60 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first
           came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh
           and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
             61 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in
           linen cloths with the spices, as the manner of the Jews
           is to bury.
             62 Now in the place where he was crucified there was
           a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was
           never man yet laid.
             63 There laid they Jesus,
             64 And rolled a great stone to the door of the
           sepulchre, and departed.
