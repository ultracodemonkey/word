Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.
They said, Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn't he spoken also with us? Yahweh heard it.
Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth.
Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out you three to the tent of meeting. They three came out.
Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
He said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.
My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:
with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Yahweh shall he see: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
The anger of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.
The cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as \white as\ snow: and Aaron looked at Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please don't lay sin on us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.
Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, Heal her, God, I beg you.
Yahweh said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.
Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days: and the people didn't travel until Miriam was brought in again.
Afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
