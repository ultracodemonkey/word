Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season.
In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, you shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances of it, shall you keep it.
Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover.
They kept the Passover in the first \month\, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
There were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
and those men said to him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel?
Moses said to them, Stay you, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the Passover to Yahweh.
In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:
they shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break a bone of it: according to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it.
But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbears to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he didn't offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
If a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to the ordinance of it, so shall he do: you shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him who is born in the land.
On the day that the tent was reared up the cloud covered the tent, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was on the tent as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
So it was always: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.
At the commandment of Yahweh the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped: as long as the cloud abode on the tent they remained encamped.
When the cloud stayed on the tent many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Yahweh, and didn't travel.
Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tent; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they journeyed.
Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or \if it continued\ by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud stayed on the tent, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn't travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled.
At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they journeyed: they kept the charge of Yahweh, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
