It happened on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tent, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture of it, and the altar and all the vessels of it, and had anointed them and sanctified them;
that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are those who were over those who were numbered:
and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tent.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Take it of them, that they may be \used\ in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they bore it on their shoulders.
The princes offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.
Yahweh said to Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar.
