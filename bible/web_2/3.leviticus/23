Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, The set feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no manner of work: it is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.
These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Yahweh's Passover.
On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to Yahweh: seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
In the first day you shall have a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work.
But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you are come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest of it, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest:
and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you: on the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
In the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
The meal-offering of it shall be two tenth parts \of an ephah\ of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering of it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
You shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
You shall count to you from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven Sabbaths shall there be complete:
even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath shall you number fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal-offering to Yahweh.
You shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts \of an ephah\: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with yeast, for first-fruits to Yahweh.
You shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bull, and two rams: they shall be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
You shall offer one male goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.
You shall make proclamation on the same day; there shall be a holy convocation to you; you shall do no servile work: it is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest: you shall leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Yahweh your God.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
You shall do no servile work; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you shall afflict your souls; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
You shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God.
For whatever soul it be who shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.
Whatever soul it be who does any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
You shall do no manner of work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even to even, shall you keep your Sabbath.
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tents for seven days to Yahweh.
On the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work.
Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh: it is a solemn assembly; you shall do no servile work.
These are the set feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;
besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which you give to Yahweh.
However on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days.
You shall keep it a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year: it is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month.
You shall dwell in booths seven days; all who are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your God.
Moses declared to the children of Israel the set feasts of Yahweh.
