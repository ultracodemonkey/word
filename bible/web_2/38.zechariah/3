He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
Yahweh said to Satan, Yahweh rebuke you, Satan; yes, Yahweh that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. To him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.
I said, Let them set a clean mitre on his head. So they set a clean mitre on his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by.
The angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua, saying,
Thus says Yahweh of hosts: If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.
Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.
For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving of it, says Yahweh of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, shall you invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.
