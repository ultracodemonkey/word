The angel who talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep.
He said to me, What see you? I said, I have seen, and, behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;
and two olive-trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.
I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
Then the angel who talked with me answered me, Don't you know what these are? I said, No, my lord.
Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Yahweh of Hosts.
Who are you, great mountain? before Zerubbabel \you shall become\ a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shouts of Grace, grace, to it.
Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me to you.
For who has despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; \these are\ the eyes of Yahweh, which run back and forth through the whole earth.
Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it?
I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden \oil\ out of themselves?
He answered me and said, "Don't you know what these are?" I said, No, my lord.
Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
