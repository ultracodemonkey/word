I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Then said I, Where go you? He said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.
Behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.
For I, says Yahweh, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says Yahweh; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky, says Yahweh.
Ho Zion, escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
For thus says Yahweh of hosts: After glory has he sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.
For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those who served them; and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me.
Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you, says Yahweh.
Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me to you.
Yahweh shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.
