For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall burn them up, says Yahweh of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and you shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.
You shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, says Yahweh of Hosts.
Remember you the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh come.
He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.
