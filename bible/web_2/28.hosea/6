Come, and let us return to Yahweh; for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck, and he will bind us up.
After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
Let us know, let us follow on to know Yahweh: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.
Ephraim, what shall I do to you? Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goes early away.
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are \as\ the light that goes forth.
For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
As troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yes, they have committed lewdness.
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there prostitution is \found\ in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
