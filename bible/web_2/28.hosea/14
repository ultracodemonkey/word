Israel, return to Yahweh your God; for you have fallen by your iniquity.
Take with you words, and return to Yahweh: tell him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render \as\ bulls \the offering of\ our lips.
Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, \You are\ our gods; for in you the fatherless finds mercy.
I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from him.
I will be as the dew to Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
Those who dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive \as\ the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent of it shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
Ephraim \shall say\, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is your fruit found.
Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Yahweh are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.
