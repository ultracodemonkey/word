The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
When Yahweh spoke at the first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitution and children of prostitution; for the land does commit great prostitution, \departing\ from Yahweh.
So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.
Yahweh said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
It shall happen at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
She conceived again, and bore a daughter. \Yahweh\ said to him, Call her name Look-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.
But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
Now when she had weaned Look-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
\Yahweh\ said, Call his name Look-ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be your \God\.
Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which can't be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, it shall be said to them, \You are\ the sons of the living God.
The children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
