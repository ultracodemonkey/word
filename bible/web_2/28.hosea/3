Yahweh said to me, Go again, love a woman beloved of \her\ friend, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.
So I bought her to me for fifteen \pieces\ of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;
and I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be any man's wife: so will I also be toward you.
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim:
afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come with fear to Yahweh and to his goodness in the latter days.
