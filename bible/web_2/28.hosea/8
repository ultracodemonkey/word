\Set\ the trumpet to your mouth. As an eagle \he comes\ against the house of Yahweh, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
They shall cry to me, My God, we Israel know you.
Israel has cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I didn't know it: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
He has cast off your calf, Samaria; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be before they attain to innocence?
For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yes, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he has no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.
Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel in which none delights.
For they are gone up to Assyria, \like\ a wild donkey alone by himself: Ephraim has hired lovers.
Yes, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.
Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been to him for sinning.
I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.
As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Yahweh doesn't accept them: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall devour the castles of it.
