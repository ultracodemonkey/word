When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
The more \the prophets\ called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to engraved images.
Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they didn't know that I healed them.
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as those who lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.
They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return \to me\.
The sword shall fall on their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour \them\, because of their own counsels.
My people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to \him who is\ on high, none at all will exalt \him\.
How shall I give you up, Ephraim? \how\ shall I cast you off, Israel? how shall I make you as Admah? \how\ shall I set you as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassion is aroused.
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you; and I will not come in wrath.
They shall walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.
They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, says Yahweh.
Ephraim compasses me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.
