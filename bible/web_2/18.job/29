Job again took up his parable, and said,
"Oh that I were as in the months of old,    As in the days when God watched over me;
When his lamp shone on my head,    And by his light I walked through darkness;
As I was in the ripeness of my days,    When the friendship of God was in my tent;
When the Almighty was yet with me,    And my children were around me;
When my steps were washed with butter,    And the rock poured out streams of oil for me!
When I went forth to the city gate,    When I prepared my seat in the street,
The young men saw me and hid themselves,    The aged rose up and stood;
The princes refrained from talking,    And laid their hand on their mouth;
The voice of the nobles was hushed,    And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;    And when the eye saw me, it commended me:
Because I delivered the poor who cried,    And the fatherless also, who had none to help him.
The blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,    And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.    My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
I was eyes to the blind,    And feet to the lame.
I was a father to the needy.    The cause of him who I didn't know, I searched out.
I broke the jaws of the unrighteous,    And plucked the prey out of his teeth.
Then I said, 'I shall die in my own house,    I shall number my days as the sand.
My root is spread out to the waters,    The dew lies all night on my branch;
My glory is fresh in me,    My bow is renewed in my hand.'
"Men listened to me, waited,    And kept silence for my counsel.
After my words they didn't speak again;    My speech fell on them.
They waited for me as for the rain.    Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.
I smiled on them when they had no confidence.    They didn't reject the light of my face.
I chose out their way, and sat as chief.    I lived as a king in the army,    As one who comforts the mourners.
