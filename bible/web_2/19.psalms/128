A Song of Ascents. <BR>Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,    Who walks in his ways.
For you will eat the labor of your hands.    You will be happy, and it will be well with you.
Your wife will be as a fruitful vine,    In the innermost parts of your house;    Your children like olive plants,    Around your table.
Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.
May Yahweh bless you out of Zion,    And may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
Yes, may you see your children's children.    Peace be upon Israel.
