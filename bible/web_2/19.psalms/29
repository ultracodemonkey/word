A Psalm by David. Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty,    Ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.    Worship Yahweh in holy array.
The voice of Yahweh is on the waters.    The God of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters.
The voice of Yahweh is powerful.    The voice of Yahweh is full of majesty.
The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars.    Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes them also to skip like a calf;    Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.
The voice of Yahweh strikes with flashes of lightning.
The voice of Yahweh shakes the wilderness.    Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Yahweh makes the deer calve,    And strips the forests bare.    In his temple everything says, "Glory!"
Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood.    Yes, Yahweh sits as King forever.
Yahweh will give strength to his people.    Yahweh will bless his people with peace.
