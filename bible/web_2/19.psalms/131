A Song of Ascents. By David. <BR>Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty, nor my eyes lofty;    Neither do I concern myself with great matters,    Or things too wonderful for me.
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,    Like a weaned child with his mother,    Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
Israel, hope in Yahweh,    From this time forth and forevermore.
