A Song of Ascents. <BR>In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.    He answered me.
Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips,    From a deceitful tongue.
What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,    You deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty,    With coals of juniper.
Woe is me, that I live in Meshech,    That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
My soul has had her dwelling too long    With him who hates peace.
I am for peace,    But when I speak, they are for war.
