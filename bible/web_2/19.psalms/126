A Song of Ascents. <BR>When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion,    We were like those who dream.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,    And our tongue with singing. Then said they among the nations,    "Yahweh has done great things for them."
Yahweh has done great things for us,    And we are glad.
Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,    Like the streams in the Negev.
Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,    Will assuredly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
