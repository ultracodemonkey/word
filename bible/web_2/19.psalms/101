A Psalm by David. <BR>I will sing of lovingkindness and justice.    To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.
I will be careful to live a blameless life.    When will you come to me?    I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
I will set no vile thing before my eyes.    I hate the deeds of faithless men.    They will not cling to me.
A perverse heart will be far from me.    I will have nothing to do with evil.
I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.    I won't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.
My eyes will be on the faithful of the land,    That they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way,    He will serve me.
He who practices deceit won't dwell within my house.    He who speaks falsehood won't be established before my eyes.
Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land;    To cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh's city.
