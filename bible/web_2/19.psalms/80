For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lilies of the Covenant." A Psalm by Asaph.
Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,    You who lead Joseph like a flock,    You who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might,    Come to save us.
Turn us again, God.    Cause your face to shine,    And we will be saved.
Yahweh God of hosts,    How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
You have fed them with the bread of tears,    And given them tears to drink in large measure.
You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.    Our enemies laugh among themselves.
Turn us again, God of hosts.    Cause your face to shine,    And we will be saved.
You brought a vine out of Egypt.    You drove out the nations, and planted it.
You cleared the ground for it.    It took deep root, and filled the land.
The mountains were covered with its shadow.    Its boughs were like God's cedars.
It sent out its branches to the sea,    Its shoots to the River.
Why have you broken down its walls,    So that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
The boar out of the wood ravages it.    The wild animals of the field feed on it.
Turn again, we beg you, God of hosts.    Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,
The stock which your right hand planted,    The branch that you made strong for yourself.
It is burned with fire. It is cut down.    They perish at your rebuke.
Let your hand be on the man of your right hand,    On the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
So we will not turn away from you.    Revive us, and we will call on your name.
Turn us again, Yahweh God of hosts.    Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
