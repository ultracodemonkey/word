Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous!    Praise is fitting for the upright.
Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre.    Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.
Sing to him a new song.    Play skillfully with a shout of joy!
For the word of Yahweh is right.    All his work is done in faithfulness.
He loves righteousness and justice.    The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Yahweh.
By the word of Yahweh were the heavens made,    All the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.    He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear Yahweh.    Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
For he spoke, and it was done.    He commanded, and it stood firm.
Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.    He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever,    The thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh,    The people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.
Yahweh looks from heaven. He sees all the sons of men.
From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the       inhabitants of the earth.
He who fashions all of their hearts.    He considers all of their works.
There is no king saved by the multitude of a host.    A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
A horse is a vain thing for safety,    Neither does he deliver any by his great power.
Behold, the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him,    On those who hope in his lovingkindness;
To deliver their soul from death,    To keep them alive in famine.
Our soul has waited for Yahweh.    He is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him,    Because we have trusted in his holy name.
Let your lovingkindness be on us, Yahweh,    Since we have hoped in you.
