For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble.    May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,
Send you help from the sanctuary,    Grant you support from Zion,
Remember all your offerings,    And accept your burnt-sacrifice. Selah.
May He grant you your heart's desire,    And fulfill all your counsel.
We will triumph in your salvation. In the name of our God we will set up our banners:    Yahweh fulfill all your petitions.
Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.    He will answer him from his holy heaven,    With the saving strength of his right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,    But we trust the name of Yahweh our God.
They are bowed down and fallen,    But we rise up, and stand upright.
Save, Yahweh;    Let the King answer us when we call!
