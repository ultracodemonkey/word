Praise Yah!    Praise, you servants of Yahweh,    Praise the name of Yahweh.
Blessed be the name of Yahweh,    From this time forth and forevermore.
From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same,    Yahweh's name is to be praised.
Yahweh is high above all nations,    His glory above the heavens.
Who is like Yahweh, our God,    Who has his seat on high,
Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
He raises up the poor out of the dust.    Lifts up the needy from the ash heap;
That he may set him with princes,    Even with the princes of his people.
He settles the barren woman in her home,    As a joyful mother of children. Praise Yah!
