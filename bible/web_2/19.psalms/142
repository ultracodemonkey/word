A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.
I cry with my voice to Yahweh.    With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.
I pour out my complaint before him.    I tell him my troubles.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,    You knew my path. In the way in which I walk,    They have hidden a snare for me.
Look on my right, and see;    For there is no one who is concerned for me.    Refuge has fled from me.    No one cares for my soul.
I cried to you, Yahweh.    I said, "You are my refuge,    My portion in the land of the living."
Listen to my cry,    For I am in desperate need. Deliver me from my persecutors,    For they are stronger than me.
Bring my soul out of prison,    That I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me,    For you will be good to me.
