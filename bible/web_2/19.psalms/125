A Song of Ascents. <BR>Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,    Which can't be moved, but remains forever.
As the mountains surround Jerusalem,    So Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forth and forevermore.
For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment       of the righteous;    So that the righteous won't put forth their hands to iniquity.
Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,    To those who are upright in their hearts.
But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,    Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.
