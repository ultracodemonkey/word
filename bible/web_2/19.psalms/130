A Song of Ascents. <BR>Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.
Lord, hear my voice.    Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.
If you, Yah, kept a record of sins,    Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with you,    Therefore you are feared.
I wait for Yahweh.    My soul waits.    I hope in his word.
My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the       morning;    More than watchmen for the morning.
Israel, hope in Yahweh,    For with Yahweh there is lovingkindness.    With him is abundant redemption.
He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
