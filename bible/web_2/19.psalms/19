For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
The heavens declare the glory of God.    The expanse shows his handiwork.
Day after day they pour forth speech,    And night after night they display knowledge.
There is no speech nor language,    Where their voice is not heard.
Their voice has gone out through all the earth,    Their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,    Like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.
His going forth is from the end of the heavens,    His circuit to the ends of it;    There is nothing hid from the heat of it.
The law of Yahweh is perfect, restoring the soul.    The testimony of Yahweh is sure, making wise the simple.
The precepts of Yahweh are right, rejoicing the heart.    The commandment of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.    The ordinances of Yahweh are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold;    Sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
Moreover by them is your servant warned.    In keeping them there is great reward.
Who can discern his errors?    Forgive me from hidden errors.
Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.    Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright,    I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart    Be acceptable in your sight,    Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
