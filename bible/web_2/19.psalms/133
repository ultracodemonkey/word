A Song of Ascents. By David. <BR>See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live       together in unity!
It is like the precious oil on the head,    That ran down on the beard,    Even Aaron's beard;    That came down on the edge of his robes;
Like the dew of Hermon,    That comes down on the hills of Zion:    For there Yahweh gives the blessing,    Even life forevermore.
