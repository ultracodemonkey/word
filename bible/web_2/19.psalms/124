A Song of Ascents. By David. <BR>If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,    Let Israel now say,
If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,    When men rose up against us;
Then they would have swallowed us up alive,    When their wrath was kindled against us;
Then the waters would have overwhelmed us,    The stream would have gone over our soul;
Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
Blessed be Yahweh,    Who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare.    The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of Yahweh,    Who made heaven and earth.
