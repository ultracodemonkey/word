A Psalm of thanksgiving. <BR>Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all you lands!
Serve Yahweh with gladness.    Come before his presence with singing.
Know that Yahweh, he is God.    It is he who has made us, and we are his.    We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,    Into his courts with praise.    Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
For Yahweh is good.    His lovingkindness endures forever,    His faithfulness to all generations.
