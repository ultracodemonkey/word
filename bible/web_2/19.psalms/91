He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High    Will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress;    My God, in whom I trust."
For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,    From the deadly pestilence.
He will cover you with his pinions,    Under his wings you will take refuge. His truth is a shield and a buckler.
You will not be afraid of the terror by night,    Nor of the arrow that flies by day;
Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,    Nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.
A thousand shall fall at your side,    And ten thousand at your right hand; But it will not come near you.
You will only look with your eyes,    And see the reward of the wicked.
For you, Yahweh, are my refuge!    You have made the Most High your habitation.
No evil will happen to you,    Neither shall any plague come near your tent.
For he will give his angels charge over you,    To guard you in all your ways.
They will bear you up in their hands,    So that you won't dash your foot against a stone.
You will tread on the lion and cobra.    You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.    I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
He will call on me, and I will answer him.    I will be with him in trouble.    I will deliver him, and honor him.
I will satisfy him with long life,    And show him my salvation.
