A Song of Ascents. <BR>I will lift up my eyes to the hills.    Where does my help come from?
My help comes from Yahweh,    Who made heaven and earth.
He will not allow your foot to be moved.    He who keeps you will not slumber.
Behold, he who keeps Israel    Will neither slumber nor sleep.
Yahweh is your keeper.    Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
The sun will not harm you by day,    Nor the moon by night.
Yahweh will keep you from all evil.    He will keep your soul.
Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in,    From this time forth, and forevermore.
