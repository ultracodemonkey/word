Oh come, let us sing to Yahweh.    Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving.    Let us make a joyful noise to him with psalms!
For Yahweh is a great God,    A great King above all gods.
In his hand are the deep places of the earth.    The heights of the mountains are also his.
The sea is his, and he made it.    His hands formed the dry land.
Oh come, let us worship and bow down.    Let us kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,
For he is our God.    We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, oh that you would hear his voice!
Don't harden your heart, as at Meribah,    As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
When your fathers tempted me,    Tested me, and saw my work.
Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,    And said, "It is a people that errs in their heart.    They have not known my ways."
Therefore I swore in my wrath,    "They won't enter into my rest."      Psalm 96
