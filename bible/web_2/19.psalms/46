For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A song for Alamoth.
God is our refuge and strength,    A very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not be afraid, though the earth changes,    Though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;
Though the waters of it roar and are troubled,    Though the mountains tremble with the swelling of it. Selah.
There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,    The holy place of the tents of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved.    God will help her at dawn.
The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.    He uttered his voice, and the earth melted.
Yahweh of Hosts is with us.    The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
Come, see the works of Yahweh,    What desolations he has made in the earth.
He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.    He breaks the bow, and cuts the spear apart.    He burns the chariots in the fire.
"Be still, and know that I am God.    I will be exalted among the nations.    I will be exalted in the earth."
Yahweh of Hosts is with us.    The God of Jacob is our refuge.  Selah.
