By David. Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity.    I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.
Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me.    Try my heart and my mind.
For your lovingkindness is before my eyes.    I have walked in your truth.
I have not sat with deceitful men,    Neither will I go in with hypocrites.
I hate the assembly of evil-doers,    And will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocence,    So I will go about your altar, Yahweh;
That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,    And tell of all your wondrous works.
Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house,    The place where your glory dwells.
Don't gather my soul with sinners,    Nor my life with bloodthirsty men;
In whose hands is wickedness,    Their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.    Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
My foot stands in an even place.    In the congregations will I bless Yahweh.
