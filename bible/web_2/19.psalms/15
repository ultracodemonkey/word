A Psalm by David. <BR>Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?    Who shall live on your holy hill?
He who walks blamelessly, does what is right,    And speaks truth in his heart;
He who doesn't slander with his tongue,    Nor does evil to his friend,    Nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
In whose eyes a vile man is despised,    But who honors those who fear Yahweh; He who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn't change;
He who doesn't lend out his money for usury,    Nor take a bribe against the innocent.  He who does these things shall never be shaken.
