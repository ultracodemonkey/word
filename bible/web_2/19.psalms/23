A Psalm by David.<BR>Yahweh is my shepherd: I shall lack nothing.
He makes me to lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.
He restores my soul. He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,    I will fear no evil, for you are with me.    Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You have anointed my head with oil.    My cup runs over.
Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days       of my life,    And I shall dwell in Yahweh's house forever.
