By David. <BR>I will give you thanks with my whole heart.    Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
I will bow down toward your holy temple,    And give thanks to your Name for your lovingkindness and for your       truth;    For you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
In the day that I called, you answered me.    You encouraged me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh,    For they have heard the words of your mouth.
Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh;    For great is Yahweh's glory.
For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;    But the proud, he knows from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me.    You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies.    Your right hand will save me.
Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me;    Your lovingkindness, Yahweh, endures forever.    Don't forsake the works of your own hands.
