Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing: only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach.
In that day shall the branch of Yahweh be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for those who are escaped of Israel.
It shall happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem;
when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.
Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory \shall be spread\ a covering.
There shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.
