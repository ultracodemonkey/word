In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.
One cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Hosts.
Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.
I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.
He said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but don't understand; and see you indeed, but don't perceive.
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.
Then said I, Lord, how long? He answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,
and Yahweh have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
If there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock of it.
