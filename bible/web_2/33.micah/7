Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer       fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no       cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fig.
The       godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright       among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man       his brother with a net.
Their hands are on that which is       evil to do it diligently; the prince asks, and the judge \is       ready\ for a reward; and the great man, he utters the evil desire       of his soul: thus they weave it together.
The best of them       is as a brier; the most upright is \worse\ than a thorn hedge:       the day of your watchmen, even your visitation, is come; now       shall be their perplexity.
Don't you trust in a neighbor;       don't you put confidence in a friend; keep the doors of your       mouth from her who lies in your bosom.
For the son       dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother,       the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies       are the men of his own house.
But as for me, I will look to       Yahweh; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear       me.
Don't rejoice against me, my enemy: when I fall, I       shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to       me.
I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have       sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment       for me: he will bring me forth to the light, \and\ I shall see       his righteousness.
Then my enemy shall see it, and shame       shall cover her who said to me, Where is Yahweh your God? My eyes       shall see \my desire\ on her; now shall she be trodden down as       the mire of the streets.
A day for building your walls! in       that day shall the decree be far removed.
In that day       shall they come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and       from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and \from\       mountain to mountain.
Yet shall the land be desolate       because of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their       doings.
Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your       heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of       Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of       old.
As in the days of your coming forth out of the land       of Egypt will I show to them marvelous things.
The nations       shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their       hand on their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.
They shall       lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth       they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall       come with fear to Yahweh our God, and shall be afraid because of       you.
Who is a God like you, that pardons iniquity, and       passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? he       doesn't retain his anger forever, because he delights in       lovingkindness.
He will again have compassion on us; he       will tread our iniquities under foot; and you will cast all their       sins into the depths of the sea.
You will perform the       truth to Jacob, \and\ the lovingkindness to Abraham, which you       have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
