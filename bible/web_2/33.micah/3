I said, Please hear, you heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house       of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?
you who hate       the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off       them, and their flesh from off their bones;
who also eat       the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and       break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and       as flesh within the caldron.
Then shall they cry to Yahweh,       but he will not answer them; yes, he will hide his face from them       at that time, according as they have worked evil in their doings.
Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who make my people       to err; who bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoever       doesn't put into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:
Therefore it shall be night to you, that you shall have no       vision; and it shall be dark to you, that you shall not divine;       and the sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be       black over them.
The seers shall be put to shame, and the       diviners confounded; yes, they shall all cover their lips; for       there is no answer of God.
But as for me, I am full of       power by the Spirit of Yahweh, and of judgment, and of might, to       declare to Jacob his disobedience, and to Israel his sin.
Please hear this you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of       the house of Israel, who abhor justice, and pervert all equity.
They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with       iniquity.
The heads of it judge for reward, and the       priests of it teach for hire, and the prophets of it divine for       money: yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, Is not Yahweh in the       midst of us? no evil shall come on us.
Therefore shall       Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall       become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of       a forest.
