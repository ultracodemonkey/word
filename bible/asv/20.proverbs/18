A man`s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his       mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.
Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah.
The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly.
He that maketh many friends \doeth it\ to his own       destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
