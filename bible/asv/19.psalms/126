When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.
Jehovah hath done great things for us, \Whereof\ we are glad.
Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves \with       him\.           Psalm 127       A Song of Ascents; of Solomon.
