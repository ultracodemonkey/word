I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises.
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto me.
A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I       destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that       they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine       eyes.
Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.
