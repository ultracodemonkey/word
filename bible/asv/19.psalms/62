For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of David. 
My soul waiteth in silence for God only: From him \cometh\ my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation: \He is\ my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay \him\, all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.     Selah
My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him.
He only is my rock and my salvation: \He is\ my high tower; I shall not be moved.
With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us.     Selah
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high       degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity.
Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart \thereon\.
God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God.
Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work.
