For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song. 
In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.
In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.
There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle.     Selah
Glorious art thou \and\ excellent, From the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,
When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth.     Selah
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.
Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that       ought to be feared.
He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
