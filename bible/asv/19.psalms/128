Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, Round about thy table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed That feareth Jehovah.
Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Yea, see thou thy children`s children. Peace be upon Israel.           Psalm 129       A Song of Ascents.
