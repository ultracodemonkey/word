Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; give ear to my supplications: In thy faithfulness answer me, \and\ in thy righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with thy servant; For in thy sight no man living is righteous.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground: He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been       long dead.
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy doings; I muse on the work of thy hands.
I spread forth my hands unto thee: My soul \thirsteth\ after thee, as a weary land.     Selah
Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; my spirit faileth: Hide not thy face from me, Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; For in thee do I trust: Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God: Thy Spirit is good; Lead me in the land of uprightness.
Quicken me, O Jehovah, for thy name`s sake: In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies, And destroy all them that afflict my soul; For I am thy servant.           Psalm 144       \A Psalm\ of David.
