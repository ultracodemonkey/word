When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?
Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,
Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.           Psalm 115
