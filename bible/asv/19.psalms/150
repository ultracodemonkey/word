Praise ye Jehovah. Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him with trumpet sound: Praise him with psaltery and harp.
Praise him with timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and pipe.
Praise him with loud cymbals: Praise him with high sounding cymbals.
Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah.
