For the Chief Musician; \set to\ Al-tash-heth. \A Psalm\ of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. 
Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until \these\ calamities be overpast.
I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth \all things\ for me.
He will send from heaven, and save me, \When\ he that would swallow me up reproacheth;     Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth.
My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; \Let\ thy glory \be\ above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves.     Selah
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
For thy lovingkindness is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; \Let\ thy glory \be\ above all the earth.
