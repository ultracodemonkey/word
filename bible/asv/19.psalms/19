For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork.
Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language; Their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.
His going forth is from the end of the heavens, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple.
The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: The ordinances of Jehovah are true, \and\ righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much       fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.
Moreover by them is thy servant warned: In keeping them there is great reward.
Who can discern \his\ errors? Clear thou me from hidden \faults\.
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous \sins\; Let them not have dominion over me: Then shall I be upright, And I shall be clear from great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.
