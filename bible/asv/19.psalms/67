For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm, a song. 
God be merciful unto us, and bless us, \And\ cause his face to shine upon us;     Selah
That thy way may be known upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, And govern the nations upon earth.     Selah
Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.
The earth hath yielded its increase: God, even our own God, will bless us.
God will bless us; And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
