A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day.
It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High;
To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,
With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.
For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep.
A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a fool understand this:
When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.
But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore.
For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn hast thou exalted like \the horn of\ the       wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.
Mine eye also hath seen \my desire\ on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard \my desire\ of the evil-doers that rise up       against me.
The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and green:
To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.           Psalm 93
