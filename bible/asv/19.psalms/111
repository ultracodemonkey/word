Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever.
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.
He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.
The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure.
They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness.
He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do \his commandments\: His praise endureth for ever.           Psalm 112
