For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. 
Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth; For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.
Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaketh great things;
Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; Our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the       sighing of the needy, Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; I will set him in the safety he panteth for.
The words of Jehovah are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, Purified seven times.
Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.
The wicked walk on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
