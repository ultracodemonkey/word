For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. 
Oh clap your hands, all ye peoples; Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
For Jehovah Most High is terrible; He is a great King over all the earth.
He subdueth peoples under us, And nations under our feet.
He chooseth our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom he loved.     Selah
God is gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praise to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
For God is the King of all the earth: Sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are gathered together \To be\ the people of the God of Abraham: For the shields of the earth belong unto God; He is greatly exalted.
