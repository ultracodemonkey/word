For the Chief Musician; \set to\ Al-tash-heth. A Psalm of Asaph; a song. 
We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.
When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it.     Selah
I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.
For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, \cometh\ lifting up.
But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.
For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine       foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall       drain them, and drink them.
But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
