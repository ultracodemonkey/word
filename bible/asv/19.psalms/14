For the Chief Musician. \A Psalm\ of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.
Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.
They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people \as\ they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah?
There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.
Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge.
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, \and\ Israel shall be glad.
