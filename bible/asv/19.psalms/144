Blessed be Jehovah my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, \And\ my fingers to fight:
My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me.
Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
Man is like to vanity: His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
Stretch forth thy hand from above; Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens;
Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their       youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a       palace;
\When\ our garners are full, affording all manner of       store, \And\ our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our       fields;
\When\ our oxen are well laden; \When there is\ no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in our streets:
Happy is the people that is in such a case; \Yea\, happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.           Psalm 145       \A\ \Psalm\ \of\ praise;  of David.
