Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him.
Jehovah hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the       nations.
He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his       faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody.
With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein;
Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together
Before Jehovah; for he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.           Psalm 99
