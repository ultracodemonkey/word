For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Consider \and\ answer me, O Jehovah my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the \sleep of\ death;
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; \Lest\ mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
But I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
I will sing unto Jehovah, Because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
