For the Chief Musician; \set to\ Al-tashheth. \A Psalm\ of David. Michtam. 
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: Set me on high from them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from the bloodthirsty men.
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.
They run and prepare themselves without \my\ fault: Awake thou to help me, and behold.
Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.     Selah
They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city.
Behold, they belch out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: For who, \say they\, doth hear?
But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.
\Because of\ his strength I will give heed unto thee; For God is my high tower.
My God with his lovingkindness will meet me: God will let me see \my desire\ upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget: Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
\For\ the sin of their mouth, \and\ the words of their       lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak.
Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall       be no more: And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, Unto the ends of the earth.      Selah
And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, And go round about the city.
They shall wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.
But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
