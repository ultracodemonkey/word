Except Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain.
It is vain for you to rise up early, To take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; \For\ so he giveth unto his beloved sleep.
Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; \And\ the fruit of the womb is \his\ reward.
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.           Psalm 128       A Song of Ascents.
