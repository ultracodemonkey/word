A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.  
Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.
Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.     Selah
But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.
I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill.     Selah
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people.     Selah
