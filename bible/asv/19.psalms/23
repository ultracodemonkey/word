A Psalm of David. Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters.
He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name`s sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of       death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine       enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all       the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever.
