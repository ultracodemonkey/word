For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. 
Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; Thou hast covered all their sin.     Selah
Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou hast turned \thyself\ from the fierceness of thine anger.
Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?
Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, And grant us thy salvation.
I will hear what God Jehovah will speak; For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them not turn again to folly.
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth springeth out of the earth; And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good; And our land shall yield its increase.
Righteousness shall go before him, And shall make his footsteps a way \to walk in\.
