For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
Thou hast given him his heart`s desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips.     Selah
For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.
He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever.
His glory is great in thy salvation: Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him.
For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence.
For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be       moved.
Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee.
Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of       thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the children of men.
For they intended evil against thee; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.
For thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.
Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power.
