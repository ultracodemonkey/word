Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth \above\ the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples.
Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he.
The king`s strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.
He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them.
Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy.           Psalm 100       A Psalm of thanksgiving.
