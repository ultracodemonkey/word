For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? 
Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me in thy might.
Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them.     Selah
Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul.
He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth.
With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; And mine eye hath seen \my desire\ upon mine enemies.
