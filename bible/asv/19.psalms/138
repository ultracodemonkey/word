I will give thee thanks with my whole heart: Before the gods will I sing praises unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, And give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy       truth: For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
In the day that I called thou answeredst me, Thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O       Jehovah, For they have heard the words of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah; For great is the glory of Jehovah.
For though Jehovah is high, yet hath he respect unto the       lowly; But the haughty he knoweth from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive       me; Thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of mine       enemies, And thy right hand will save me.
Jehovah will perfect that which concerneth me: Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, \endureth\ for ever; Forsake not the works of thine own hands.           Psalm 139       For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm of David.
