For the Chief Musician, set to Shoshanim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph. 
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest \above\ the cherubim, shine forth.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy       might, And come to save us.
Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.
Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
Thou preparedst \room\ before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land.
The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were \like\ cedars of God.
It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River.
Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
So shall we not go back from thee: Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.
Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
