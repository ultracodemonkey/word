A Psalm of Asaph. <BR>God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods.
How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked?     Selah
Judge the poor and fatherless: Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
Rescue the poor and needy: Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
They know not, neither do they understand; They walk to and fro in darkness: All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High.
Nevertheless ye shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, judge the earth; For thou shalt inherit all the nations.
