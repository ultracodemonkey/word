Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah.
Lord, hear my voice:  Let thine ears be attentive  To the voice of my supplications.
If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark iniquities,  O Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with thee,  That thou mayest be feared.
I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait,  And in his word do I hope.
My soul \waiteth\ for the Lord More than watchmen \wait\ for the morning; \Yea, more than\ watchmen for the morning.
O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption.
And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.           Psalm 131       A Song of Ascents; of David.
