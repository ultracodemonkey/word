If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, Let Israel now say,
If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, When men rose up against us;
Then they had swallowed us up alive, When their wrath was kindled against us;
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, The stream had gone over our soul;
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
Blessed be Jehovah, Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the       fowlers: The snare is broken, and we are escaped.
Our help is in the name of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.           Psalm 125       A Song of Ascents.
