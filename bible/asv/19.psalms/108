A Song, A Psalm of David.
My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the       peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth \reacheth\ unto the skies.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.           Psalm 109       For the Chief Musicion. A Psalm of David.
