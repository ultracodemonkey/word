For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,
That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see them?
They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, \say they\, a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep.
But God will shoot at them; With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.
So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being       against them: All that see them shall wag the head.
And all men shall fear; And they shall declare the work of God, And shall wisely consider of his doing.
The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take       refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.
