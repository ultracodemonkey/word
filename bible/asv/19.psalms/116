I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications.
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call \upon him\ as long as I live.
The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful.
Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me.
Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, \And\ my feet from falling.
I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living.
I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted:
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints.
O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people,
In the courts of Jehovah`s house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.           Psalm 117
