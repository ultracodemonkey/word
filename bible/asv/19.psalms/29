A Psalm of David. Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name; Worship Jehovah in holy array.
The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: The God of glory thundereth, Even Jehovah upon many waters.
The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.
The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire.
The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, And strippeth the forests bare: And in his temple everything saith, Glory.
Jehovah sat \as King\ at the Flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever.
Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.
