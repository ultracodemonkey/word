A Psalm of David. The earth is Jehovah`s, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully.
He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, \even\ Jacob.     Selah
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.
Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.
Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory.     Selah
