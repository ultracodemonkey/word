In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me.
Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, \And\ from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done       more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper.
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
My soul hath long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace.
I am \for\ peace: But when I speak, they are for war.           Psalm 121       A Song of Ascents.
