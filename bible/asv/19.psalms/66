For the Chief Musician. A song, a Psalm. Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:
Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious.
Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit       themselves unto thee.
All the earth shall worship thee, And shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name.     Selah
Come, and see the works of God; \He is\ terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him.
He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves.     Selah
Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life, And suffereth not our feet to be moved.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins.
Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, when I was in distress.
I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats.     Selah
Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
I cried unto him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear:
But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me.
