Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of       Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Thy people offer themselves willingly  In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning Thou hast the dew of thy youth.
Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at thy right hand Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
He will judge among the nations, He will fill \the places\ with dead bodies; He will strike through the head in many countries.
He will drink of the brook in the way: Therefore will he lift up the head.           Psalm 111
