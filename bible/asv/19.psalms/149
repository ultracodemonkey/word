Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp.
For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation.
Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
\Let\ the high praises of God \be\ in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand;
To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples;
To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;
To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.           Psalm 150
