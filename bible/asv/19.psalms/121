I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come?
My help \cometh\ from Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep.
Jehovah is thy keeper: Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night.
Jehovah will keep thee from all evil; He will keep thy soul.
Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in From this time forth and for evermore.           Psalm 122       A Song of Ascents; of David.
