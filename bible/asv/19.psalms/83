A song. A Psalm of Asaph. 
O God, keep not thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Thy take crafty counsel against thy people, And consult together against thy hidden ones.
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being       a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have consulted together with one consent; Against thee do they make a covenant:
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot.     Selah
Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.
O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.
As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,
So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm.
Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.
Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish;
That they may know that thou alone, whose name is       Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth.
