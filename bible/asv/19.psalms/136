Even a heritage unto Israel his servant; For his lovingkindness \endureth\ for ever:
Who remembered us in our low estate; For his lovingkindness \endureth\ for ever;
And hath delivered us from our adversaries; For his lovingkindness \endureth\ for ever:
Who giveth food to all flesh; For his lovingkindness \endureth\ for ever.
Oh give thanks unto the God of heaven; For his lovingkindness \endureth\ for ever.           Psalm 137
