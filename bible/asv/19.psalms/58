For the Chief Musician; \set to\ Al-tashheth. \A Psalm\ of David. Michtam. 
Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: \They are\ like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,
Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Charming never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.
Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut       off.
\Let them be\ as a snail which melteth and passeth away, \Like\ the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the       burning alike.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the       righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.             For the Chief Musician; \set to\ Al-tashheth. \A Psalm\ of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.
