Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say,
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows.
Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion.
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up;
Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.           Psalm 130       A Song of Ascents.
