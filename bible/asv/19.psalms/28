\A Psalm\ of David. Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call: My rock, be not thou deaf unto me; Lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
Draw me not away with the wicked, And with the workers of iniquity; That speak peace with their neighbors, But mischief is in their hearts.
Give them according to their work, and according to the       wickedness of their doings: Give them after the operation of their hands; Render to them their desert.
Because they regard not the works of Jehovah, Nor the operation of his hands, He will break them down and not build them up.
Blessed be Jehovah, Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
Jehovah is my strength and my shield; My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; And with my song will I praise him.
Jehovah is their strength, And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.
