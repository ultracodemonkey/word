Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself       therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.
Thy throne is established of old: Thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.
Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty.
Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.           Psalm 94
