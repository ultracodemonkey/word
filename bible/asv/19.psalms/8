For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. 
O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the       earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou       established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?
For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.
Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy       hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:
All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,
The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
