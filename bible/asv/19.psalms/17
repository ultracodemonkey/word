A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; Let thine eyes look upon equity.
Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the       night; Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
My steps have held fast to thy paths, My feet have not slipped.
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, \and\ hear my speech.
Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge \in       thee \From those that rise up \against them\.
Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly.
They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast \us\ down to the earth.
He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O Jehovah,  Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;
From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, whose portion is in \this\ life, And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with \beholding\ thy form.
