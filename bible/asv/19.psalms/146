Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
While I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God:
Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever;
Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners;
Jehovah openeth \the eyes of\ the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous;
Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.           Psalm 147
