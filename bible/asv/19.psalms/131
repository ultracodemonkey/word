Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise myself in great matters, Or in things too wonderful for me.
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child with his mother, Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.           Psalm 132       A Song of Ascents.
