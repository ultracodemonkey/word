Jehovah, remember for David All his affliction;
How he sware unto Jehovah, And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, Nor go up into my bed;
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Or slumber to mine eyelids;
Until I find out a place for Jehovah, A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: We found it in the field of the wood.
We will go into his tabernacles; We will worship at his footstool.
Arise, O Jehovah, into thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priest be clothed with righteousness; And let thy saints shout for joy.
For thy servant David`s sake Turn not away the face of thine anointed.
Jehovah hath sworn unto David in truth; He will not turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
If thy children will keep my covenant And my testimony that I shall teach them, Their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.
For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for his habitation.
This is my resting-place for ever: Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame; But upon himself shall his crown flourish.           Psalm 133       A Song of Ascents; of David.
