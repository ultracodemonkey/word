For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. 
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of       Jehovah; My heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, My King, and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: They will be still praising thee.     Selah
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the highways \to Zion\.
Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a       place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.
They go from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.
O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob.     Selah
Behold, O God our shield, And look upon the face of thine anointed.
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
O Jehovah of hosts, Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
