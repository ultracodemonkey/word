\A Psalm\ of David. Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?
When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, \Even\ mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then will I be confident.
One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after; That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple.
For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his       pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock.
And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies       round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.
Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
\When thou saidst\, Seek ye my face; My heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.
Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me, Then Jehovah will take me up.
Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty.
\I had fainted\, unless I had believed to see the       goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living.
Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.
