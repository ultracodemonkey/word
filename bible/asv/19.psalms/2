Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?
The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, \saying\,
Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us.
He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.
Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:
Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion.
I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.
Ask of me, and I will give \thee\ the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter`s vessel.
Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.
