For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. \A Psalm\ of David. 
Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my       heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For thou hast been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings.     Selah
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou hast given \me\ the heritage of those that fear thy name.
Thou wilt prolong the king`s life; His years shall be as many generations.
He shall abide before God for ever: Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, That I may daily perform my vows.
