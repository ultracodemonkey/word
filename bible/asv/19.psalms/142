Maschil of David, when he was in the cave;  a Prayer.
I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication.
I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me.
Look on \my\ right hand, and see; For there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.           Psalm 143       A Psalm of David.
