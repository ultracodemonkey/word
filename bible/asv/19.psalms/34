A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. 
I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad.
Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together.
I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.
They looked unto him, and were radiant; And their faces shall never be confounded.
This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles.
The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear       him, And delivereth them.
Oh taste and see that Jehovah is       good: Blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him.
Oh fear Jehovah, ye his saints; For there is no want to them that fear him.
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing.
Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
What man is he that desireth life, And loveth \many\ days, that he may see good?
Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile.
Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous, And his ears are \open\ unto their cry.
The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
\The righteous\ cried, and Jehovah heard, And delivered them out of all their troubles.
Jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But Jehovah delivereth him out of them all.
He keepeth all his bones: Not one of them is broken.
Evil shall slay the wicked; And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.
Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.
