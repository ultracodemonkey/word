Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah.
Blessed be the name of Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the       same Jehovah`s name is to be praised.
Jehovah is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That hath his seat on high,
That humbleth himself to behold \The things that are\ in heaven and in the earth?
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;
That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house, \And to be\ a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.           Psalm 114
