Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly       nation: Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou cast       me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me: Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, And to thy tabernacles.
Then will I go unto the altar of God, Unto God my exceeding joy; And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, \Who is\ the help of my countenance, and my God.
