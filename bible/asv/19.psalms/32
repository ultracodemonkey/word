\A Psalm\ of David. Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not       iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.
When I kept silence, my bones wasted away Through my groaning all the day long.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: My moisture was changed \as\ with the drought of summer.     Selah
I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.     Selah
For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a       time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto       him.
Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from       trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance.     Selah
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou       shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no       understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, \Else\ they will not come near unto thee.
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass       him about.
Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
