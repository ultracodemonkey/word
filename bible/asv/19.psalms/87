A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.     Selah
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them       that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there.
Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was       born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her.
Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there.     Selah
They that sing as well as they that dance \shall say\, All my fountains are in thee.
