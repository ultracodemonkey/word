Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary \beast\.
They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne \by me\ from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;
and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry \you\; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver.
To whom will ye like me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?
Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; they fall down, yea, they worship.
They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not remove: yea, one may cry unto it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.
Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; \I am\ God, and there is none like me;
declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not \yet\ done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;
calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.
Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness:
I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
