Then Job answered and said,
I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all.
Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul`s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.
\But\ I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage \your grief\.
Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?
But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company.
And thou hast laid fast hold on me, \which\ is a witness       \against me\: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face.
He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.
God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.
I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark.
His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.
My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.
O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no \resting\ -place.
Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high.
My friends scoff at me: \But\ mine eye poureth out tears unto God,
That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!
For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
