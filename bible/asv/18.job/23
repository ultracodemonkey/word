Then Job answered and said,
Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!
I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.
I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Behold, I go forward, but he is not \there\; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;
On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold       him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside.
I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my       necessary food.
But he is in one \mind\, and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.
Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.
For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
