Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?
Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes.
But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,
And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine       iniquity deserveth.
Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.
If he pass through, and shut up, And all unto judgment, then who can hinder him?
For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.
But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born \as\ a wild ass`s colt.
If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him;
If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.
Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,
And \thy\ life shall be clearer than the noonday;  Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search \about thee\, and shalt take thy rest in       safety.
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee       afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.
