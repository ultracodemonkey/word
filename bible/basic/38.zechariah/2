Ho, ho! go in flight from the land of the north, says the Lord: for I have sent you far and wide to the four winds of heaven, says the Lord.

And a number of nations will be joined to the Lord in that day, and will become my people; and I will be living among you, and you will see that the Lord of armies has sent me to you.
And Judah will be the Lord's heritage in the holy land, and Jerusalem will again be his.
Let all flesh be quiet and make no sound before the Lord: for he is awake and has come from his holy resting-place.
