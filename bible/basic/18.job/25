Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,
Rule and power are his; he makes peace in his high places.
Is it possible for his armies to be numbered? and on whom is not his light shining?
How then is it possible for man to be upright before God? or how may he be clean who is a son of woman?
See, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not clean in his eyes:
How much less man who is an insect, and the son of man who is a worm!
