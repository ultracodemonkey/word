And Job made answer and said,
Even today my outcry is bitter; his hand is hard on my sorrow.
If only I had knowledge of where he might be seen, so that I might come even to his seat!
I would put my cause in order before him, and my mouth would be full of arguments.
I would see what his answers would be, and have knowledge of what he would say to me.
Would he make use of his great power to overcome me? No, but he would give attention to me.
There an upright man might put his cause before him; and I would be free for ever from my judge.
See, I go forward, but he is not there; and back, but I do not see him;
I am looking for him on the left hand, but there is no sign of him; and turning to the right, I am not able to see him.
For he has knowledge of the way I take; after I have been tested I will come out like gold.
My feet have gone in his steps; I have kept in his way, without turning to one side or to the other.
I have never gone against the orders of his lips; the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart.
But his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it; and he gives effect to the desire of his soul.
For what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end: and his mind is full of such designs.
For this cause I am in fear before him, my thoughts of him overcome me.
For God has made my heart feeble, and my mind is troubled before the Ruler of all.
For I am overcome by the dark, and by the black night which is covering my face.
