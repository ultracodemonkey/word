O make a new song to the Lord; let all the earth make melody to the Lord.
Make songs to the Lord, blessing his name; give the good news of his salvation day by day.
Make clear his glory to the nations, and his wonders to all the peoples.
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; he is more to be feared than all other gods.
For all the gods of the nations are false gods; but the Lord made the heavens.
Honour and glory are before him: strong and fair is his holy place.
Give to the Lord, O you families of the peoples, give to the Lord glory and strength.
Give to the Lord the glory of his name; take with you an offering and come into his house.
O give worship to the Lord in holy robes; be in fear before him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, The Lord is King; yes, the world is ordered so that it may not be moved; he will be an upright judge of the peoples.
Let the heavens have joy and the earth be glad; let the sea be thundering with all its waters;
Let the field be glad, and everything which is in it; yes, let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy,
Before the Lord, for he is come; he is come to be the judge of the earth; the earth will be judged in righteousness, and the peoples with unchanging faith.
