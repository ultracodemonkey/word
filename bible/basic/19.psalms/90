A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.<BR> Lord, you have been our resting-place in all generations.
Before the mountains were made, before you had given birth to the earth and the world, before time was, and for ever, you are God.
You send man back to his dust; and say, Go back, you children of men.
For to you a thousand years are no more than yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night.
...
In the morning it is green; in the evening it is cut down, and becomes dry.
We are burned up by the heat of your passion, and troubled by your wrath.
You have put our evil doings before you, our secret sins in the light of your face.
For all our days have gone by in your wrath; our years come to an end like a breath.
The measure of our life is seventy years; and if through strength it may be eighty years, its pride is only trouble and sorrow, for it comes to an end and we are quickly gone.
Who has knowledge of the power of your wrath, or who takes note of the weight of your passion?
So give us knowledge of the number of our days, that we may get a heart of wisdom.
Come back, O Lord; how long? let your purpose for your servants be changed.
In the morning give us your mercy in full measure; so that we may have joy and delight all our days.
Make us glad in reward for the days of our sorrow, and for the years in which we have seen evil.
Make your work clear to your servants, and your glory to their children.
Let the pleasure of the Lord our God be on us: O Lord, give strength to the work of our hands.
