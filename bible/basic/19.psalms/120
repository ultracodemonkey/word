A Song of the going up.<BR> In my trouble my cry went up to the Lord, and he gave me an answer.
O Lord, be the saviour of my soul from false lips, and from the tongue of deceit.
What punishment will he give you? what more will he do to you, you false tongue?
Sharp arrows of the strong, and burning fire.
Sorrow is mine because I am strange in Meshech, and living in the tents of Kedar.
My soul has long been living with the haters of peace.
I am for peace: but when I say so, they are for war.
