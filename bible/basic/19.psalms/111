Let the Lord be praised. I will give praise to the Lord with all my heart, among the upright, and in the meeting of the people.
The works of the Lord are great, searched out by all those who have delight in them.
His work is full of honour and glory; and his righteousness is unchanging for ever.
Certain for ever is the memory of his wonders: the Lord is full of pity and mercy.
He has given food to his worshippers; he will keep his agreement in mind for ever.
He has made clear to his people the power of his works, giving them the heritage of the nations.
The works of his hands are faith and righteousness; all his laws are unchanging.
They are fixed for ever and ever, they are done in faith and righteousness.
He has sent salvation to his people; he has given his word for ever: holy is his name and greatly to be feared.
The fear of the Lord is the best part of wisdom: all those who keep his laws are wise: his praise is eternal.
