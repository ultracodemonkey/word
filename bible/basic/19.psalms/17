A Prayer. Of David.<BR> Let my cause come to your ears, O Lord, give attention to my cry; give ear to my prayer which goes not out from false lips.
Be my judge; for your eyes see what is right.
You have put my heart to the test, searching me in the night; you have put me to the test and seen no evil purpose in me; I will keep my mouth from sin.
As for the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.
I have kept my feet in your ways, my steps have not been turned away.
My cry has gone up to you, for you will give me an answer, O God: let your ear be turned to me, and give attention to my words.
Make clear the wonder of your mercy, O saviour of those who put their faith in your right hand, from those who come out against them.
Keep me as the light of your eyes, covering me with the shade of your wings,
From the evil-doers who are violent to me, and from those who are round me, desiring my death.
They are shut up in their fat: with their mouths they say words of pride.
They have made a circle round our steps: their eyes are fixed on us, forcing us down to the earth;
Like a lion desiring its food, and like a young lion waiting in secret places.
Up! Lord, come out against him, make him low, with your sword be my saviour from the evil-doer.
With your hand, O Lord, from men, even men of the world, whose heritage is in this life, and whom you make full with your secret wealth: they are full of children; after their death their offspring take the rest of their goods.
As for me, I will see your face in righteousness: when I am awake it will be joy enough for me to see your form.
