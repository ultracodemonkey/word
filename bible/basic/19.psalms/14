To the chief music-maker. Of David.<BR> The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good.
The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.
They have all gone out of the way together; they are unclean, there is not one who does good, no, not one.
Have all the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food as they would take bread; they make no prayer to the Lord.
Then were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the upright.
You have put to shame the thoughts of the poor, but the Lord is his support.
May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! when the fate of his people is changed by the Lord, Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad.
