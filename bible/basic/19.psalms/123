A Song of the going up.<BR> To you my eyes are lifted up, even to you whose seat is in the heavens.
See! as the eyes of servants are turned to the hands of their masters, and the eyes of a servant-girl to her owner, so our eyes are waiting for the Lord our God, till he has mercy on us.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: for all men are looking down on us.
For long enough have men of pride made sport of our soul.
