To the chief music-maker; put to Jonath elem rehokim. Of David. Michtam. When the Philistines took him in Gath.
Have mercy on me, O God, for man is attempting my destruction; every day he makes cruel attacks against me.
My haters are ever ready to put an end to me; great numbers are lifting themselves up against me.
In the time of my fear, I will have faith in you.
In God will I give praise to his word; in God have I put my hope; I will have no fear of what flesh may do to me.
Every day they make wrong use of my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They come together, they are waiting in secret places, they take note of my steps, they are waiting for my soul.
By evil-doing they will not get free from punishment. In wrath, O God, let the peoples be made low.
You have seen my wanderings; put the drops from my eyes into your bottle; are they not in your record?
When I send up my cry to you, my haters will be turned back; I am certain of this, for God is with me.
In God will I give praise to his word; in the Lord will I give praise to his word.
In God have I put my hope, I will have no fear of what man may do to me.
I keep the memory of my debt to you, O God; I will give you the offerings of praise.
Because you have taken my soul from the power of death; and kept my feet from falling, so that I may be walking before God in the light of life.
