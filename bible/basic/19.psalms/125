A Song of the going up.<BR> Those whose hope is in the Lord are like the mountain of Zion, which may not be moved, but keeps its place for ever.
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people, from this time and for ever.
For the rod of sinners will not be resting on the heritage of the upright; so that the upright may not put out their hands to evil.
Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in heart.
But as for such as are turned out of the straight way, the Lord will take them away with the workers of evil. Let peace be on Israel.
