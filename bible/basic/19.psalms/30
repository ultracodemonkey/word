A Psalm. A Song at the blessing of the House. Of David.
I will give you praise and honour, O Lord, because through you I have been lifted up; you have not given my haters cause to be glad over me.
O Lord my God, I sent up my cry to you, and you have made me well.
O Lord, you have made my soul come again from the underworld: you have given me life and kept me from going down among the dead.
Make songs to the Lord, O you saints of his, and give praise to his holy name.
For his wrath is only for a minute; in his grace there is life; weeping may be for a night, but joy comes in the morning.
When things went well for me I said, I will never be moved.
Lord, by your grace you have kept my mountain strong: when your face was turned from me I was troubled.
My voice went up to you, O Lord; I made my prayer to the Lord.
What profit is there in my blood if I go down into the underworld? will the dust give you praise, or be a witness to your help?
Give ear to me, O Lord, and have mercy on me: Lord, be my helper.
By you my sorrow is turned into dancing; you have taken away my clothing of grief, and given me robes of joy;
So that my glory may make songs of praise to you and not be quiet. O Lord my God, I will give you praise for ever.
