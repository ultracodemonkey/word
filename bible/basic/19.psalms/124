A Song of the going up. Of David.<BR> If it had not been the Lord who was on our side (let Israel now say);
If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men came up against us;
They would have made a meal of us while still living, in the heat of their wrath against us:
We would have been covered by the waters; the streams would have gone over our soul;
Yes, the waters of pride would have gone over our soul.
Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be wounded by their teeth.
Our soul has gone free like a bird out of the net of those who would take her: the net is broken, and we are free.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
