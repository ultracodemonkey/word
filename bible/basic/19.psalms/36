To the chief music-maker. Of the servant of the Lord. Of David.
The sin of the evil-doer says in his heart, There is no fear of the Lord before his eyes.
For he takes comfort in the thought that his sin will not be uncovered and hated.
In the words of his mouth are evil and deceit; he has given up being wise and doing good.
He gives thought to evil on his bed; he takes a way which is not good; he is not a hater of evil.
Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and your strong purpose is as high as the clouds.
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judging is like the great deep; O Lord, you give life to man and beast.
How good is your loving mercy, O God! the children of men take cover under the shade of your wings.
The delights of your house will be showered on them; you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures.
For with you is the fountain of life: in your light we will see light.
O let there be no end to your loving mercy to those who have knowledge of you, or of your righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come against me, or the hand of the evil-doers put me out of my place.
There the workers of evil have come down: they have been made low, and will not be lifted up.
