Michtam. Of David.<BR> Keep me safe, O God: for in you I have put my faith.
O my soul, you have said to the Lord, You are my Lord: I have no good but you.
As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the noble in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows will be increased who go after another god: I will not take drink offerings from their hands, or take their names on my lips.
The Lord is my heritage and the wine of my cup; you are the supporter of my right.
Fair are the places marked out for me; I have a noble heritage.
I will give praise to the Lord who has been my guide; knowledge comes to me from my thoughts in the night.
I have put the Lord before me at all times; because he is at my right hand, I will not be moved.
Because of this my heart is glad, and my glory is full of joy: while my flesh takes its rest in hope.
For you will not let my soul be prisoned in the underworld; you will not let your loved one see the place of death.
You will make clear to me the way of life; where you are joy is complete; in your right hand there are pleasures for ever and ever.
