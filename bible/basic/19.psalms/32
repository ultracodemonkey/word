Of David. Maschil.<BR> Happy is he who has forgiveness for his wrongdoing, and whose sin is covered.
Happy is the man in whom the Lord sees no evil, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
When I kept my mouth shut, my bones were wasted, because of my crying all through the day.
For the weight of your hand was on me day and night; my body became dry like the earth in summer. (Selah.)
I made my wrongdoing clear to you, and did not keep back my sin. I said, I will put it all before the Lord; and you took away my wrongdoing and my sin. (Selah.)
For this cause let every saint make his prayer to you at a time when you are near: then the overflowing of the great waters will not overtake him.
You are my safe and secret place; you will keep me from trouble; you will put songs of salvation on the lips of those who are round me. (Selah.)
I will give you knowledge, teaching you the way to go; my eye will be your guide.
Do not be like the horse or the ass, without sense; ...
The sinner will be full of trouble; but mercy will be round the man who has faith in the Lord.
Be glad in the Lord with joy, you upright men; give cries of joy, all you whose hearts are true.
