Let the Lord be praised. Happy is the man who gives honour to the Lord, and has great delight in his laws.
His seed will be strong on the earth; blessings will be on the generation of the upright.
A store of wealth will be in his house, and his righteousness will be for ever.
For the upright there is a light shining in the dark; he is full of grace and pity.
All is well for the man who is kind and gives freely to others; he will make good his cause when he is judged.
He will not ever be moved; the memory of the upright will be living for ever.
He will have no fear of evil news; his heart is fixed, for his hope is in the Lord.
His heart is resting safely, he will have no fear, till he sees trouble come on his haters.
He has given with open hands to the poor; his righteousness is for ever; his horn will be lifted up with honour.
The sinner will see it with grief; he will be wasted away with envy; the desire of the evil-doers will come to nothing.
