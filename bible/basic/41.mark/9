And they put a question to him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first?
And he said to them, Truly, Elijah does come first, and puts all things in order; and how is it said in the Writings that the Son of man will go through much sorrow and be made as nothing?

And one of the number said to him in answer, Master, I came to you with my son, who has in him a spirit which takes away his power of talking;
And wherever it takes him, it puts him down violently, streaming at the lips and twisted with pain; and his strength goes from him; and I made a request to your disciples to send it out, and they were not able.
And he said to them in answer, O generation without faith, how long will I have to be with you? how long will I put up with you? let him come to me.

John said to him, Master, we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name: and we said that he might not, because he is not one of us.
