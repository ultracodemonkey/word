And Mordecai took his rest in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the palace.
And he heard their plan, and searched out their purposes, and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Ahasuerus the king; and so he testified to the king about them.
Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after they had confessed, they were strangled.
And the king made a record of these things, and Mordecai also wrote thereof.
So the king commanded, Mordecai to serve in the court, and for this he rewarded him.
However, Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, was in great honor with the king, and sought to injure Mordecai and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.
