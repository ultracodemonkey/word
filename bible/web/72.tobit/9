Then Tobias called Raphael and said to him,
"Brother Azariah, take a servant and two camels with you, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money and bring him to the wedding.
For Raguel has sworn that I shall not depart,
but my father counts the days, and if I delay for long, he will be very sorrowful."
So Raphael went out and lodged with Gabael and gave him the handwriting, so he brought out bags which were sealed up and gave them to him.
And early in the morning they both went forth together, and they arrived at the wedding; and Tobias blessed his wife.
