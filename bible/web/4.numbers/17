Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
"Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write every man's name on his rod.
You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.
You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you."
Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.
It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
Yahweh said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die."
Moses did so. As Yahweh commanded him, so he did.
The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone!
Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Yahweh, dies! Will we all perish?"
