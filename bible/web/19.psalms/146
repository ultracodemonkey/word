Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul.
While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
Don't put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom there is no help.
His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish.
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Yahweh, his God:
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;
who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners.
Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind. Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous.
Yahweh preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!
