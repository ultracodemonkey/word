{A Song of Ascents. By David.} If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, let Israel now say,
if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us;
then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;
then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul;
then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
