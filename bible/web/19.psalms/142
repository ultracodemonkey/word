{A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.} I cry with my voice to Yahweh. With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.
I pour out my complaint before him. I tell him my troubles.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my path. In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my soul.
I cried to you, Yahweh. I said, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need. deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.
