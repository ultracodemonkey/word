And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber  of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.
And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king  over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, because of his  people Israel.
And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begot  more sons and daughters.
And these are the names of the children which he had in  Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over  all Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and  David heard \of it\, and went out against them.
And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the  valley of Rephaim.
And David inquired of God saying, Shall I go up against  the Philistines, and wilt thou give them into my hand? And  Jehovah said to him, Go up; and I will give them into thy hand.
And they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them  there; and David said, God has broken in upon mine enemies by  my hand, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore they called  the name of that place Baal-perazim.
And they left their gods there; and David commanded, and  they were burned with fire.
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves in the  valley.
And David inquired again of God; and God said to him, Go  not up after them; turn round them and come upon them opposite  the mulberry-trees.
And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching  in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out  to battle; for God will have gone forth before thee to smite  the army of the Philistines.
And David did as God commanded him; and they smote the  army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah  brought the fear of him upon all the nations.
