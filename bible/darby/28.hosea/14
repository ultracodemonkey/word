O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen  by thine iniquity.
Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah; say unto him,  Forgive all iniquity, and receive \us\ graciously; so will we  render the calves of our lips.
Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses:  neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, \Thou  art\ our God; because in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for  mine anger is turned away from him.
I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as the  lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
His shoots shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the  olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
They shall return and sit under his shadow; they shall  revive \as\ corn, and blossom as the vine: the renown thereof  shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
Ephraim \shall say\, What have I to do any more with idols?  (I answer \him\, and I will observe him.) I am like a green  fir-tree. -- From me is thy fruit found.
Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?  intelligent, and he shall know them? For the ways of Jehovah  are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the  transgressors shall fall therein.
