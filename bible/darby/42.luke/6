And it came to pass on \the\ second-first sabbath, that he  went through cornfields, and his disciples were plucking the  ears and eating \them\, rubbing \them\ in their hands.
But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is  not lawful to do on the sabbath?
And Jesus answering said to them, Have ye not read so much  as this, what David did when he hungered, he and those who were  with him,
how he entered into the house of God and took the shewbread  and ate, and gave to those also who were with him, which it is  not lawful that \any\ eat, unless the priests alone?
And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath  also.
And it came to pass on another sabbath also that he entered  into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there, and  his right hand was withered.
And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching if he would  heal on the sabbath, that they might find something of which to  accuse him.
But *he* knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had  the withered hand, Get up, and stand in the midst. And having  risen up he stood \there\.
Jesus therefore said to them, I will ask you if it is lawful  on the sabbath to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to  destroy \it\?
And having looked around on them all, he said to him,  Stretch out thy hand. And he did \so\ and his hand was restored  as the other.
But *they* were filled with madness, and they spoke  together among themselves what they should do to Jesus.
And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the  mountain to pray, and he spent the night in prayer to God.
And when it was day he called his disciples, and having  chosen out twelve from them, whom also he named apostles:
Simon, to whom also he gave the name of Peter, and Andrew  his brother, \and\ James and John, \and\ Philip and  Bartholomew,
\and\ Matthew and Thomas, James the \son\ of Alphaeus and  Simon who was called Zealot,
\and\ Judas \brother\ of James, and Judas Iscariote, who  was also \his\ betrayer;
and having descended with them, he stood on a level place,  and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of the  people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre  and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their  diseases;
and those that were beset by unclean spirits were healed.
And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power went out  from him and healed all.
And *he*, lifting up his eyes upon his disciples, said,  Blessed \are\ ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
Blessed ye that hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Blessed  ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.
Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall  separate you \from them\, and shall reproach \you\, and cast  out your name as wicked, for the Son of man`s sake:
rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your  reward is great in the heaven, for after this manner did their  fathers act toward the prophets.
But woe to you rich, for ye have received your consolation.
Woe to you that are filled, for ye shall hunger. Woe to you  who laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep.
Woe, when all men speak well of you, for after this manner  did their fathers to the false prophets.
But to you that hear I say, Love your enemies; do good to  those that hate you;
bless those that curse you; pray for those who use you  despitefully.
To him that smites thee on the cheek, offer also the other;  and from him that would take away thy garment, forbid not thy  body-coat also.
To every one that asks of thee, give; and from him that  takes away what is thine, ask it not back.
And as ye wish that men should do to you, do *ye* also to  them in like manner.
And if ye love those that love you, what thank is it to  you? for even sinners love those that love them.
And if ye do good to those that do good to you, what thank  is it to you? for even sinners do the same.
And if ye lend to those from whom ye hope to receive, what  thank is it to you? \for\ even sinners lend to sinners that  they may receive the like.
But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for  nothing in return, and your reward shall be great, and ye shall  be sons of \the\ Highest; for *he* is good to the unthankful  and wicked.
Be ye therefore merciful, even as your Father also is  merciful.
And judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and  ye shall not be condemned. Remit, and it shall be remitted to  you.
Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed  down, and shaken together, and running over, shall be given  into your bosom: for with the same measure with which ye mete  it shall be measured to you again.
And he spoke also a parable to them: Can a blind \man\ lead  a blind \man\? shall not both fall into \the\ ditch?
The disciple is not above his teacher, but every one that  is perfected shall be as his teacher.
But why lookest thou on the mote which is in the eye of thy  brother, but perceivest not the beam which is in thine own eye?
or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, allow \me\,  I will cast out the mote that is in thine eye, thyself not  seeing the beam that is in thine eye? Hypocrite, cast out first  the beam out of thine eye, and then thou shalt see clear to  cast out the mote which is in the eye of thy brother.
For there is no good tree which produces corrupt fruit, nor  a corrupt tree which produces good fruit;
for every tree is known by its own fruit, for figs are not  gathered from thorns, nor grapes vintaged from a bramble.
The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings  forth good; and the wicked \man\ out of the wicked, brings  forth what is wicked: for out of the abundance of the heart his  mouth speaks.
And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things that  I say?
Every one that comes to me, and hears my words and does  them, I will shew you to whom he is like.
He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep,  and laid a foundation on the rock; but a great rain coming, the  stream broke upon that house, and could not shake it, for it  had been founded on the rock.
And he that has heard and not done, is like a man who has  built a house on the ground without \a\ foundation, on which  the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the breach of  that house was great.
