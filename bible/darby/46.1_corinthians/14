Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual  \manifestations\, but rather that ye may prophesy.
For he that speaks with a tongue does not speak to men but  to God: for no one hears; but in spirit he speaks mysteries.
But he that prophesies speaks to men \in\ edification, and  encouragement, and consolation.
He that speaks with a tongue edifies himself; but he that  prophesies edifies \the\ assembly.
Now I desire that ye should all speak with tongues, but  rather that ye should prophesy. But greater is he that  prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he  interpret, that the assembly may receive edification.
And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues,  what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in  revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
Even lifeless things giving a sound, whether pipe or harp,  if they give not distinction to the sounds, how shall it be  known what is piped or harped?
For also, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall  prepare himself for war?
Thus also *ye* with the tongue, unless ye give a distinct  speech, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be  speaking to the air.
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the  world, and none of undistinguishable sound.
If therefore I do not know the power of the sound, I shall  be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks a  barbarian for me.
Thus *ye* also, since ye are desirous of spirits, seek  that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly.
Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he  may interpret.
For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit prays, but my  understanding is unfruitful.
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will  pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit,  but I will sing also with the understanding.
Since otherwise, if thou blessest with \the\ spirit, how  shall he who fills the place of the simple \Christian\ say  Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know what thou  sayest?
For *thou* indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not  edified.
I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you:
but in \the\ assembly I desire to speak five words with my  understanding, that I may instruct others also, \rather\ than  ten thousand words in a tongue.
Brethren, be not children in \your\ minds, but in malice  be babes; but in \your\ minds be grown \men\.
It is written in the law, By people of other tongues, and  by strange lips, will I speak to this people; and neither thus  will they hear me, saith the Lord.
So that tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe,  but to unbelievers; but prophecy, not to unbelievers, but to  those who believe.
If therefore the whole assembly come together in one  place, and all speak with tongues, and simple \persons\ enter  in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad?
But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple  \person\ come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all;
the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling  upon \his\ face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God  is indeed amongst you.
What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each  \of you\ has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a  revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to  edification.
If any one speak with a tongue, \let it be\ two, or at the  most three, and separately, and let one interpret;
but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in \the\  assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.
And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others  judge.
But if there be a revelation to another sitting \there\,  let the first be silent.
For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and  all be encouraged.
And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
For God is not \a God\ of disorder but of peace, as in all  the assemblies of the saints.
Let \your\ women be silent in the assemblies, for it is  not permitted to them to speak; but to be in subjection, as the  law also says.
But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own  husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in  assembly.
Did the word of God go out from you, or did it come to you  only?
If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual,  let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is  \the\ Lord`s commandment.
But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid  the speaking with tongues.
But let all things be done comelily and with order.
