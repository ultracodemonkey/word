But concerning spiritual \manifestations\, brethren, I do  not wish you to be ignorant.
Ye know that when ye were \of the\ nations \ye were\ led  away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led.
I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in \the  power of the\ Spirit of God, says, Curse \on\ Jesus; and no one  can say, Lord Jesus, unless in \the power of the\ Holy Spirit.
But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;
and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord;
and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God  who operates all things in all.
But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for  profit.
For to one, by the Spirit, is given \the\ word of wisdom;  and to another \the\ word of knowledge, according to the same  Spirit;
and to a different one faith, in \the power of\ the same  Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in \the power of\ the  same Spirit;
and to another operations of miracles; and to another  prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a  different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation  of tongues.
But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit,  dividing to each in particular according as he pleases.
For even as the body is one and has many members, but all  the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also \is\  the Christ.
For also in \the power of\ one Spirit *we* have all been  baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen  or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit.
For also the body is not one member but many.
If the foot say, Because I am not a hand I am not of the  body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?
And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye I am not of  the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?
If the whole body \were\ an eye, where the hearing? if all  hearing, where the smelling?
But now God has set the members, each one of them in the  body, according as it has pleased \him\.
But if all were one member, where the body?
But now the members \are\ many, and the body one.
The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee;  or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of you.
But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be  weaker are necessary;
and those \parts\ of the body which we esteem to be the  more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour;  and our uncomely \parts\ have more abundant comeliness;
but our comely \parts\ have not need. But God has tempered  the body together, having given more abundant honour to \the  part\ that lacked;
that there might be no division in the body, but that the  members might have the same concern one for another.
And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with  \it\; and if one member be glorified, all the members rejoice  with \it\.
Now *ye* are Christ`s body, and members in particular.
And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles;  secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers;  then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues.
\Are\ all apostles? \are\ all prophets? \are\ all  teachers? \are\ all \in possession of\ miraculous powers?
have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do  all interpret?
But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I  unto you a way of more surpassing excellence.
