Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and  stewards of \the\ mysteries of God.
Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found  faithful.
But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined  of you or of man`s day. Nor do I even examine myself.
For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not  justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.
So that do not judge anything before \the\ time, until the  Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden  things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of  hearts; and then shall each have \his\ praise from God.
Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their  application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may  learn in us the \lesson of\ not \letting your thoughts go\  above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for  \such a\ one against another.
For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou  hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest  thou as not receiving?
Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye  have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we*  also might reign with you.
For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last,  as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the  world, both to angels and men.
*We* \are\ fools for Christ`s sake, but *ye* prudent in  Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in  dishonour.
To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in  nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,
and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we  bless; persecuted, we suffer \it\;
insulted, we entreat: we are become as \the\ offscouring of  the world, \the\ refuse of all, until now.
Not \as\ chiding do I write these things to you, but as my  beloved children I admonish \you\.
For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ,  yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you  through the glad tidings.
I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.
For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my  beloved and faithful child in \the\ Lord, who shall put you in  mind of my ways \as\ they \are\ in Christ, according as I teach  everywhere in every assembly.
But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to  you;
but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I  will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the  power.
For the kingdom of God \is\ not in word, but in power.
What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love,  and \in\ a spirit of meekness?
