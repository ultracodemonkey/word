If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have  not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.
And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all  knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains,  but have not love, I am nothing.
And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I  deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I  profit nothing.
Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous \of  others\; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up,
does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what  is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil,
does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth,
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,  endures all things.
Love never fails; but whether prophecies, they shall be  done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall  be done away.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part:
but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in  part shall be done away.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child,  I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had done with  what belonged to the child.
For we see now through a dim window obscurely, but then  face to face; now I know partially, but then I shall know  according as I also have been known.
And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and  the greater of these \is\ love.
