Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus  our Lord? are not *ye* my work in \the\ Lord?
If I am not an apostle to others, yet at any rate I am to  you: for the seal of mine apostleship are *ye* in \the\ Lord.
My defence to those who examine me is this:
Have we not a right to eat and to drink?
have we not a right to take round a sister \as\ wife, as  also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and  Cephas?
Or *I* alone and Barnabas, have we not a right not to work?
Who ever carries on war at his own charges? who plants a  vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? or who herds a flock  and does not eat of the milk of the flock?
Do I speak these things as a man, or does not the law also  say these things?
For in the law of Moses it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle  the ox that is treading out corn. Is God occupied about the  oxen,
or does he say \it\ altogether for our sakes? For for our  sakes it has been written, that the plougher should plough in  hope, and he that treads out corn, in hope of partaking of  \it\.
If we have sown to you spiritual things, \is it a\ great  \thing\ if *we* shall reap your carnal things?
If others partake of this right over you, should not rather  *we*? But we have not used this right, but we bear all things,  that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings of  the Christ.
Do ye not know that they who labour \at\ sacred things eat  of the \offerings offered in the\ temple; they that attend at  the altar partake with the altar?
So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the  glad tidings to live of the glad tidings.
But *I* have used none of these things. Now I have not  written these things that it should be thus in my case; for \it  were\ good for me rather to die than that any one should make  vain my boast.
For if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast  of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe to me if I  should not announce the glad tidings.
For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not  of my own will, I am entrusted with an administration.
What is the reward then that I have? That in announcing the  glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless \to others\, so  as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in  \announcing\ the glad tidings.
For being free from all, I have made myself bondman to all,  that I might gain the most \possible\.
And I became to the Jews as a Jew, in order that I might  gain the Jews: to those under law, as under law, not being  myself under law, in order that I might gain those under law:
to those without law, as without law, (not as without law  to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ,) in order that I  might gain \those\ without law.
I became to the weak, \as\ weak, in order that I might gain  the weak. To all I have become all things, in order that at all  events I might save some.
And I do all things for the sake of the glad tidings, that  I may be fellow-partaker with them.
Know ye not that they who run in \the\ race-course run all,  but one receives the prize? Thus run in order that ye may  obtain.
But every one that contends \for a prize\ is temperate in  all things: *they* then indeed that they may receive a  corruptible crown, but *we* an incorruptible.
*I* therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; so I combat, as  not beating the air.
But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest \after\  having preached to others I should be myself rejected.
