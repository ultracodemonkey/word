Christ, then, having suffered for us in \the\ flesh, do *ye*  also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that has  suffered in \the\ flesh has done with sin,
no longer to live the rest of \his\ time in \the\ flesh to  men`s lusts, but to God`s will.
For the time past \is\ sufficient \for us\ to have wrought  the will of the Gentiles, walking in lasciviousness, lusts,  wine-drinking, revels, drinkings, and unhallowed idolatries.
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with \them\ to  the same sink of corruption, speaking injuriously \of you\;
who shall render account to him who is ready to judge \the\  living and \the\ dead.
For to this \end\ were the glad tidings preached to \the\  dead also, that they might be judged, as regards men, after  \the\ flesh, but live, as regards God, after \the\ Spirit.
But the end of all things is drawn nigh: be sober therefore,  and be watchful unto prayers;
but before all things having fervent love among yourselves,  because love covers a multitude of sins;
hospitable one to another, without murmuring;
each according as he has received a gift, ministering it to  one another, as good stewards of \the\ various grace of God.
If any one speak -- as oracles of God; if any one minister  -- as of strength which God supplies; that God in all things  may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and  the might for the ages of ages. Amen.
Beloved, take not \as\ strange the fire \of persecution\  which has taken place amongst you for \your\ trial, as if a  strange thing was happening to you;
but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice,  that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with  exultation.
If ye are reproached in \the\ name of Christ, blessed \are  ye\; for the \Spirit\ of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon  you: \on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is  glorified.\
Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer, or thief, or  evildoer, or as overseer of other people`s matters;
but if as a christian, let him not be ashamed, but glorify  God in this name.
For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of  God \is come\; but if first from us, what \shall be\ the end of  those who obey not the glad tidings of God?
And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the  impious and \the\ sinner appear?
Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of  God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.
