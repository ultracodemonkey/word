Likewise, wives, \be\ subject to your own husbands, that,  even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained  without \the\ word by the conversation of the wives,
having witnessed your pure conversation \carried out\ in  fear;
whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of  hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel;
but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible  \ornament\ of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of  God is of great price.
For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God  heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own  husbands;
as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye  have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of  consternation.
\Ye\ husbands likewise, dwell with \them\ according to  knowledge, as with a weaker, \even\ the female, vessel, giving  \them\ honour, as also fellow-heirs of \the\ grace of life,  that your prayers be not hindered.
Finally, \be\ all of one mind, sympathising, full of  brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded;
not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on  the contrary, blessing \others\, because ye have been called to  this, that ye should inherit blessing.
For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause  his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no  guile.
And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and  pursue it;
because \the\ eyes of \the\ Lord \are\ on \the\ righteous,  and his ears towards their supplications; but \the\ face of  \the\ Lord \is\ against them that do evil.
And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of  that which \is\ good?
But if also ye should suffer for righteousness` sake,  blessed \are ye\; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be  troubled;
but sanctify \the\ Lord the Christ in your hearts, and \be\  always prepared to \give\ an answer \to\ every one that asks  you to give an account of the hope that \is\ in you, but with  meekness and fear;
having a good conscience, that \as to that\ in which they  speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed who  calumniate your good conversation in Christ.
For \it is\ better, if the will of God should will it, to  suffer \as\ well-doers than \as\ evildoers;
for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, \the\ just  for \the\ unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to  death in flesh, but made alive in \the\ Spirit,
in which also going he preached to the spirits \which are\  in prison,
heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God  waited in \the\ days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into  which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:
which figure also now saves you, \even\ baptism, not a  putting away of \the\ filth of flesh, but \the\ demand as  before God of a good conscience, by \the\ resurrection of Jesus  Christ,
who is at \the\ right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels  and authorities and powers being subjected to him.
