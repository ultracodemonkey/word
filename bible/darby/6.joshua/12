Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, \and\  ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon,  and from the middle of the ravine, and over half Gilead, as far  as the river Jabbok, \which is\ the border of the children of  Ammon;
and the plain as far as the sea of Chinneroth on the east,  and as far as the sea of the plain, the salt sea, on the east,  toward Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of  Pisgah;
and the territory of Og the king of Bashan, of the residue  of the giants, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
and ruled over mount Hermon, and over Salcah, and over all  Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the  Maachathites, and \over\ half Gilead \as far as\ the border of  Sihon the king of Heshbon.
