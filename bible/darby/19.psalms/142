{An instruction of David; when he was in the cave: a  prayer.} 
I cry unto Jehovah with my voice: with my voice unto  Jehovah do I make supplication.
I pour out my plaint before him; I shew before him my  trouble.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then *thou*  knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they hidden a  snare for me.
Look on the right hand and see; there is no man that  knoweth me: refuge hath failed me; no man careth for my soul.
I cried unto thee, Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, my  portion in the land of the living.
Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me  from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may celebrate thy  name. The righteous shall surround me, because thou dealest  bountifully with me.
