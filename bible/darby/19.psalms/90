{A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.} Lord, *thou* hast been  our dwelling-place in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst  formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity  thou art ùGod.
Thou makest \mortal\ man to return to dust, and sayest,  Return, children of men.
For a thousand years, in thy sight, are as yesterday when  it is past, and \as\ a watch in the night.
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are \as\ a  sleep: in the morning they are like grass \that\ groweth up:
In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up; in the  evening it is cut down and withereth.
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy fury are we  troubled.
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret \sins\  in the light of thy countenance.
For all our days pass away in thy wrath: we spend our years  as a \passing\ thought.
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and  if, by reason of strength, they be fourscore years, yet their  pride is labour and vanity, for it is soon cut off, and we fly  away.
Who knoweth the power of thine anger? and thy wrath  according to the fear of thee?
So teach \us\ to number our days, that we may acquire a  wise heart.
Return, Jehovah: how long? and let it repent thee  concerning thy servants.
Satisfy us early with thy loving-kindness; that we may  sing for joy and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days \wherein\ thou hast  afflicted us, according to the years \wherein\ we have seen  evil.
Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy majesty  unto their sons.
And let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us; and  establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of  our hands, establish thou it.
