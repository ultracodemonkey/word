{Of David. Instruction.} Blessed is he \whose\  transgression is forgiven, \whose\ sin is covered!
Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah reckoneth not  iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile!
When I kept silence, my bones waxed old, through my  groaning all the day long.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; my moisture  was turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity I  covered not; I said, I will confess my transgressions unto  Jehovah, and *thou* forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee at a  time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great  waters they will not reach him.
Thou art a hiding-place for me; thou preservest me from  trouble; thou dost encompass me with songs of deliverance.  Selah.
I will instruct thee and teach thee the way in which thou  shalt go; I will counsel \thee\ with mine eye upon thee.
Be ye not as a horse, as a mule, which have no  understanding: whose trappings must be bit and bridle, for  restraint, or they will not come unto thee.
Many sorrows hath the wicked; but he that confideth in  Jehovah, loving-kindness shall encompass him.
Rejoice in Jehovah, and be glad, ye righteous; and shout  for joy, all ye upright in heart.
