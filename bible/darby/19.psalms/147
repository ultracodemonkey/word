Praise ye Jah! for it is good. Sing psalms of our God; for  it is pleasant: praise is comely.
Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth the outcasts  of Israel.
He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their  wounds.
He counteth the number of the stars; he giveth names to  them all.
Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding  is infinite.
Jehovah lifteth up the meek; he abaseth the wicked to the  earth.
Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; sing psalms upon the  harp unto our God:
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain  for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains;
Who giveth to the cattle their food, to the young ravens  which cry.
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse, he taketh  not pleasure in the legs of a man;
Jehovah taketh pleasure in those that fear him, in those  that hope in his loving-kindness.
Laud Jehovah, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath  blessed thy children within thee;
He maketh peace in thy borders; he satisfieth thee with  the finest of the wheat.
He sendeth forth his oracles to the earth: his word  runneth very swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool, scattereth the hoar frost like  ashes;
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand  before his cold?
He sendeth his word, and melteth them; he causeth his  wind to blow -- the waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his  judgments unto Israel.
He hath not dealt thus with any nation; and as for \his\  judgments, they have not known them. Hallelujah!
