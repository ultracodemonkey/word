{An instruction: of Asaph.} Why, O God, hast thou cast off  for ever? \why\ doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy  pasture?
Remember thine assembly, which thou hast purchased of old,  which thou hast redeemed \to be\ the portion of thine  inheritance, this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
Lift up thy steps unto the perpetual desolations:  everything in the sanctuary hath the enemy destroyed.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy place of  assembly; they set up their signs \for\ signs.
\A man\ was known as he could lift up axes in the thicket  of trees;
And now they break down its carved work altogether, with  hatchets and hammers.
They have set on fire thy sanctuary, they have profaned the  habitation of thy name to the ground.
They said in their heart, Let us destroy them together:  they have burned up all ùGod`s places of assembly in the land.
We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet, neither  is there among us any that knoweth how long.
How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the  enemy contemn thy name for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, and thy right hand? \pluck  it\ out of thy bosom: consume \them\.
But God is my king of old, accomplishing deliverances in  the midst of the earth.
*Thou* didst divide the sea by thy strength; thou didst  break the heads of the monsters on the waters:
*Thou* didst break in pieces the heads of leviathan, thou  gavest him to be meat to those that people the desert.
*Thou* didst cleave fountain and torrent, *thou* driedst  up ever-flowing rivers.
The day is thine, the night also is thine; *thou* hast  prepared the moon and the sun:
*Thou* hast set all the borders of the earth; summer and  winter -- *thou* didst form them.
Remember this, that an enemy hath reproached Jehovah, and  a foolish people have contemned thy name.
Give not up the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild  beast; forget not the troop of thine afflicted for ever.
Have respect unto the covenant; for the dark places of the  earth are full of the dwellings of violence.
Oh let not the oppressed one return ashamed; let the  afflicted and needy praise thy name.
Rise up, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the  foolish man reproacheth thee all the day;
Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: the tumult of  those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
