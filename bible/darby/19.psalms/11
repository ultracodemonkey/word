{To the chief Musician. \A Psalm\ of David.} In Jehovah  have I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee \as\ a bird to  your mountain?
For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their  arrow upon the string, that they may in darkness shoot at the  upright in heart.
If the foundations be destroyed, what shall the righteous  do?
Jehovah \is\ in the temple of his holiness; Jehovah, -- his  throne is in the heavens: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the  children of men.
Jehovah trieth the righteous one; but the wicked, and him  that loveth violence, his soul hateth.
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone;  and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
For righteous is Jehovah; he loveth righteousness, his  countenance doth behold the upright.
