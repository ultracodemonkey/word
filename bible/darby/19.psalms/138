{\A Psalm\ of David.} I will give thee thanks with my  whole heart; before the gods will I sing psalms of thee.
I will bow down toward the temple of thy holiness, and  celebrate thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth;  for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
In the day when I called thou answeredst me; thou didst  encourage me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall celebrate thee, Jehovah,  when they have heard the words of thy mouth;
And they shall sing in the ways of Jehovah, for great is  the glory of Jehovah.
For Jehovah is high; but he looketh upon the lowly, and  the proud he knoweth afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive  me: thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the anger of mine  enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
Jehovah will perfect what concerneth me: thy  loving-kindness, O Jehovah, \endureth\ for ever; forsake not  the works of thine own hands.
