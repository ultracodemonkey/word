{A Psalm of praise. Of David.} I will extol thee, my God,  O King, and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name  for ever and ever.
Great is Jehovah, and exceedingly to be praised; and his  greatness is unsearchable.
One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall  declare thy mighty acts.
I will speak of the glorious splendour of thy majesty, and  of thy wondrous works.
And they shall tell of the might of thy terrible acts; and  thy great deeds will I declare.
They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great  goodness, and shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
Jehovah is gracious and merciful; slow to anger, and of  great loving-kindness.
Jehovah is good to all; and his tender mercies are over  all his works.
All thy works shall praise thee, Jehovah, and thy saints  shall bless thee.
They shall tell of the glory of thy kingdom, and speak of  thy power;
To make known to the children of men his mighty acts, and  the glorious splendour of his kingdom.
Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, and thy dominion is  throughout all generations.
Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all that  are bowed down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them  their food in its season.
Thou openest thy hand, and satisfiest the desire of every  living thing.
Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, and kind in all his  works.
Jehovah is nigh unto all that call upon him, unto all  that call upon him in truth.
He fulfilleth the desire of them that fear him; he  heareth their cry, and saveth them.
Jehovah keepeth all that love him, and all the wicked  will he destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; and let all  flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
