{\A Psalm\ of David.} Blessed be Jehovah my rock, who  teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight;
My mercy and my fortress, my high tower and my deliverer,  my shield and he in whom I trust, who subdueth my people under  me!
Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him,  the son of man, that thou takest thought of him?
Man is like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that  passeth away.
Jehovah, bow thy heavens, and come down; touch the  mountains, that they smoke;
Cast forth lightnings, and scatter them; send forth thine  arrows, and discomfit them:
Stretch out thy hands from above; rescue me, and deliver  me out of great waters, from the hand of aliens,
Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a  right hand of falsehood.
O God, I will sing a new song unto thee; with the  ten-stringed lute will I sing psalms unto thee:
Who givest salvation unto kings; who rescuest David thy  servant from the hurtful sword.
Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of aliens, whose  mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of  falsehood.
That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth;  our daughters as corner-columns, sculptured after the fashion  of a palace:
Our granaries full, affording all manner of store; our  sheep bringing forth thousands, ten thousands in our pastures;
Our kine laden \with young\; no breaking in and no going  forth, and no outcry in our streets.
Blessed the people that is in such a case! Blessed the  people whose God is Jehovah!
