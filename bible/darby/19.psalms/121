{A Song of degrees.} I lift up mine eyes unto the  mountains: whence shall my help come?
My help \cometh\ from Jehovah, who made the heavens and  the earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he that keepeth  thee will not slumber.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel will neither slumber nor  sleep.
Jehovah is thy keeper, Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right  hand;
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by  night.
Jehovah will keep thee from all evil; he will keep thy  soul.
Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in, from  henceforth and for evermore.
