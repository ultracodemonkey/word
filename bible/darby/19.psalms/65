{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David: a Song.} 
Praise  waiteth for thee in silence, O God, in Zion; and unto thee  shall the vow be performed.
O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
Iniquities have prevailed against me: our transgressions,  thou wilt forgive them.
Blessed is he whom thou choosest and causest to approach:  he shall dwell in thy courts. We shall be satisfied with the  goodness of thy house, of thy holy temple.
By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O  God of our salvation, thou confidence of all the ends of the  earth, and of the distant regions of the sea. ...
Who by his strength established the mountains, being girded  with power;
Who stilleth the raging of the seas, the raging of their  waves, and the tumult of the peoples.
And they that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at  thy tokens; thou makest the outgoings of the morning and  evening to rejoice.
Thou hast visited the earth, thou hast watered it; thou  greatly enrichest it: the river of God is full of water; thou  providest their corn, when thou hast so prepared it:
Thou dost satiate its furrows, thou smoothest its clods,  thou makest it soft with showers; thou blessest the springing  thereof.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness, and thy paths  drop fatness:
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness, and the  hills are girded with gladness.
The meadows are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are  covered over with corn; they shout for joy, yea, they sing.
