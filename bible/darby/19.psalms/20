{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} 
Jehovah answer  thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob  protect thee;
May he send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen  thee out of Zion;
Remember all thine oblations, and accept thy  burnt-offering; Selah.
Grant thee according to thy heart, and fulfil all thy  counsels.
We will triumph in thy salvation, and in the name of our  God will we set up our banners. Jehovah fulfil all thy  petitions!
Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; he answereth  him from the heavens of his holiness, with the saving strength  of his right hand.
Some make mention of chariots, and some of horses, but we  of the name of Jehovah our God.
They are bowed down and fallen; but we are risen and stand  upright.
Save, Jehovah! Let the king answer us in the day we call.
