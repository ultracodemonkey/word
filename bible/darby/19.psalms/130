{A Song of degrees.} Out of the depths do I call upon  thee, Jehovah.
Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the  voice of my supplication.
If thou, Jah, shouldest mark iniquities, Lord, who shall  stand?
But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be  feared.
I wait for Jehovah; my soul doth wait, and in his word do  I hope.
My soul \waiteth\ for the Lord more than the watchers  \wait\ for the morning, \more than\ the watchers for the  morning.
Let Israel hope in Jehovah, because with Jehovah there is  loving-kindness, and with him is plenteous redemption;
And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
