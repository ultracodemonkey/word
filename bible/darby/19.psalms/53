{To the chief Musician. On Mahalath: an instruction. Of  David.} 
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God! They  have corrupted themselves, and have done abominable iniquity:  there is none that doeth good.
God looked down from the heavens upon the children of men,  to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek  God.
Every one of them is gone back, they are together become  corrupt: there is none that doeth good, not even one.
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, eating up my  people \as\ they eat bread? they call not upon God.
There were they in great fear, where no fear was; for God  scattereth the bones of him that encampeth against thee. Thou  hast put \them\ to shame, for God hath despised them.
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When  God turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob shall be  glad, Israel shall rejoice.
