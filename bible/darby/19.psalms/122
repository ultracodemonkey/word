{A Song of degrees. Of David.} I rejoiced when they said  unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah.
Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, which art built as a city that is compact  together,
Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of Jah, a testimony  to Israel, to give thanks unto the name of Jehovah.
For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the  house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that  love thee.
Peace be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy  palaces.
For my brethren and companions` sakes I will say, Peace be  within thee!
Because of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy  good.
