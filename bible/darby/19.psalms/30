{A Psalm of David: dedication-song of the house.} 
I will  extol thee, Jehovah; for thou hast delivered me, and hast not  made mine enemies to rejoice over me.
Jehovah my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol, thou hast  quickened me from among those that go down to the pit.
Sing psalms unto Jehovah, ye saints of his, and give thanks  in remembrance of his holiness.
For a moment \is passed\ in his anger, a life in his  favour; at even weeping cometh for the night, and at morn there  is rejoicing.
As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.
Jehovah, by thy favour thou hadst made my mountain to stand  strong: thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.
I called to thee, Jehovah, and unto the Lord did I make  supplication:
What profit is there in my blood, in my going down to the  pit? shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Jehovah, and be gracious unto me; Jehovah, be my  helper.
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou  hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
That \my\ glory may sing psalms of thee, and not be  silent. Jehovah my God, I will praise thee for ever.
