{A Psalm.} Sing ye unto Jehovah a new song: for he hath  done wondrous things; his right hand and his holy arm hath  wrought salvation for him.
Jehovah hath made known his salvation: his righteousness  hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations.
He hath remembered his loving-kindness and his faithfulness  toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen  the salvation of our God.
Shout aloud unto Jehovah, all the earth; break forth and  shout for joy, and sing psalms.
Sing psalms unto Jehovah with the harp: with the harp, and  the voice of a song;
With trumpets and sound of cornet, make a joyful noise  before the King, Jehovah.
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and  they that dwell therein;
Let the floods clap \their\ hands; let the mountains sing  for joy together,
Before Jehovah, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will  judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with  equity.
