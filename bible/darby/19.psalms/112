Hallelujah! Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, that  delighteth greatly in his commandments.
His seed shall be mighty in the land; the generation of  the upright shall be blessed.
Wealth and riches \shall be\ in his house; and his  righteousness abideth for ever.
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness; he  is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
It is well with the man that is gracious and lendeth; he  will sustain his cause in judgment.
For he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be  in everlasting remembrance.
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed  confiding in Jehovah;
His heart is maintained, he is not afraid, until he see  \his desire\ upon his oppressors.
He scattereth abroad, he giveth to the needy; his  righteousness abideth for ever: his horn shall be exalted with  honour.
The wicked \man\ shall see \it\ and be vexed; he shall  gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked  shall perish.
