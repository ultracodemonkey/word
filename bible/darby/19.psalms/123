{A Song of degrees.} Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O  thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, as the eyes of servants \look\ unto the hand of  their masters, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her  mistress, so our eyes \are directed\ to Jehovah our God, until  he be gracious unto us.
Be gracious unto us, O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; for  we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those  that are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
