{A Psalm of Asaph.} <BR>God standeth in the assembly of ùGod,  he judgeth among the gods.
How long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the person  of the wicked? Selah.
Judge the poor and the fatherless, do justice to the  afflicted and the destitute;
Rescue the poor and needy, deliver them out of the hand of  the wicked.
They know not, neither do they understand; they walk on in  darkness: all the foundations of the earth are moved.
I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of  the Most High;
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the  princes.
Arise, O God, judge the earth; for *thou* shalt inherit all  the nations.
