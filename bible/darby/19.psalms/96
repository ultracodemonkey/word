Sing ye unto Jehovah a new song: sing unto Jehovah, all the  earth.
Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; publish his salvation  from day to day.
Declare his glory among the nations, his wondrous works  among all the peoples.
For Jehovah is great and exceedingly to be praised; he is  terrible above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but Jehovah made  the heavens.
Majesty and splendour are before him; strength and beauty  are in his sanctuary.
Give unto Jehovah, ye families of peoples, give unto  Jehovah glory and strength;
Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name; bring an oblation  and come into his courts;
Worship Jehovah in holy splendour; tremble before him, all  the earth.
Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth! yea, the world is  established, it shall not be moved; he will execute judgment  upon the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let  the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
Let the field exult and all that is therein. Then shall  all the trees of the forest sing for joy,
Before Jehovah, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the  earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the  peoples in his faithfulness.
