Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the  wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not  in the seat of scorners;
But his delight is in Jehovah`s law, and in his law doth he  meditate day and night.
And he \is\ as a tree planted by brooks of water, which  giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and  all that he doeth prospereth.
The wicked are not so; but are as the chaff which the wind  driveth away.
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor  sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of  the wicked shall perish.
