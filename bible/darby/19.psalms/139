{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, thou  hast searched me, and known \me\.
*Thou* knowest my down-sitting and mine uprising, thou  understandest my thought afar off;
Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, and art  acquainted with all my ways;
For there is not yet a word on my tongue, \but\ lo, O  Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.
Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thy hand  upon me.
O knowledge too wonderful for me! it is high, I cannot  \attain\ unto it.
Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? and whither flee from  thy presence?
If I ascend up into the heavens thou art there; or if I  make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou \art there\;
\If\ I take the wings of the dawn \and\ dwell in the  uttermost parts of the sea,
Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand  shall hold me.
And if I say, Surely darkness shall cover me, and the  light about me be night;
Even darkness hideth not from thee, and the night shineth  as the day: the darkness is as the light.
For thou hast possessed my reins; thou didst cover me in  my mother`s womb.
I will praise thee, for I am fearfully, wonderfully made.  Marvellous are thy works; and \that\ my soul knoweth right  well.
My bones were not hidden from thee when I was made in  secret, curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth.
Thine eyes did see my unformed substance, and in thy book  all \my members\ were written; \during many\ days were they  fashioned, when \as yet\ there was none of them.
But how precious are thy thoughts unto me, O ùGod! how  great is the sum of them!
\If\ I would count them, they are more in number than the  sand. When I awake, I am still with thee.
Oh that thou wouldest slay the wicked, O +God! And ye men  of blood, depart from me.
For they speak of thee wickedly, they take \thy name\ in  vain, thine enemies.
Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? and do not  I loathe them that rise up against thee?
I hate them with perfect hatred; I account them mine  enemies.
Search me, O ùGod, and know my heart; prove me, and know  my thoughts;
And see if there be any grievous way in me; and lead me  in the way everlasting.
