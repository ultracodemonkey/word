{A Psalm of thanksgiving.} Shout aloud unto Jehovah, all  the earth!
Serve Jehovah with joy: come before his presence with  exultation.
Know that Jehovah is God: it is he that hath made us, and  not we ourselves; \we are\ his people, and the sheep of his  pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving \and\ into his  courts with praise; give thanks unto him, bless his name:
For Jehovah is good; his loving-kindness \endureth\ for  ever; and his faithfulness from generation to generation.
