{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} 
Hear, O God, my  voice in my plaint; preserve my life from fear of the enemy:
Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, from the  tumultuous crowd of the workers of iniquity,
Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword, \and\ have  aimed their arrow, a bitter word;
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do  they shoot at him, and fear not.
They encourage themselves in an evil matter, they concert  to hide snares; they say, Who will see them?
They devise iniquities: We have it ready, the plan is  diligently sought out. And each one`s inward \thought\ and  heart is deep.
But God will shoot an arrow at them: suddenly are they  wounded;
By their own tongue they are made to fall over one another:  all that see them shall flee away.
And all men shall fear, and shall declare God`s doing; and  they shall wisely consider his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in Jehovah, and trust in him;  and all the upright in heart shall glory.
