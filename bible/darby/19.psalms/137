By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept  when we remembered Zion.
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
For there they that carried us away captive required of us  a song; and they that made us wail \required\ mirth, \saying,\  Sing us \one\ of the songs of Zion.
How should we sing a song of Jehovah`s upon a foreign  soil?
If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget \its  skill\;
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to my  palate: if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
Remember, O Jehovah, against the sons of Edom, the day of  Jerusalem; who said, Lay \it\ bare, Lay \it\ bare, down to its  foundation!
Daughter of Babylon, who art to be laid waste, happy he  that rendereth unto thee that which thou hast meted out to us.
Happy he that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against  the rock.
