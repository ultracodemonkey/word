{A Song of degrees.} Jehovah, remember for David all his  affliction;
How he swore unto Jehovah, vowed unto the Mighty One of  Jacob:
I will not come into the tent of my house, I will not go  up to the couch of my bed;
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine  eyelids,
Until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the  Mighty One of Jacob. ...
Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah, we found it in the  fields of the wood.
Let us go into his habitations, let us worship at his  footstool.
Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy  strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy  saints shout for joy.
For thy servant David`s sake, turn not away the face of  thine anointed.
Jehovah hath sworn \in\ truth unto David; he will not  turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy  throne;
If thy children keep my covenant, and my testimonies  which I will teach them, their children also for evermore shall  sit upon thy throne.
For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his  dwelling:
This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have  desired it.
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her  needy ones with bread;
And I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her  saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I cause the horn of David to bud forth; I have  ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself  shall his crown flourish.
