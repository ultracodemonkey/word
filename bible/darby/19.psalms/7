{Shiggaion of David, which he sang to Jehovah, concerning  the words of Cush the Benjaminite.} 
Jehovah my God, in thee  have I trusted: save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me;
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, crushing it while there is  no deliverer.
Jehovah my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in  my hands;
If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me;  (indeed I have freed him that without cause oppressed me;)
Let the enemy pursue after my soul, and take \it\, and let  him tread down my life to the earth, and lay my glory in the  dust. Selah.
Arise, Jehovah, in thine anger; lift thyself up against the  raging of mine oppressors, and awake for me: thou hast  commanded judgment.
And the assembly of the peoples shall encompass thee; and  for their sakes return thou on high.
Jehovah shall minister judgment to the peoples. Judge me,  Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to mine  integrity which is in me.
Oh let the wrong of the wicked come to an end, and establish  thou the righteous \man\; even thou that triest the hearts and  reins, the righteous God.
My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart.
God is a righteous judge, and a ùGod who is indignant all  the day.
If one turn not, he will sharpen his sword; he hath bent  his bow and made it ready,
And he hath prepared for him instruments of death; his  arrows hath he made burning.
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, yea, he hath conceived  mischief, and brought forth falsehood:
He digged a pit, and hollowed it out, and is fallen into  the hole that he made.
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his  violence shall come down upon his own pate.
I will praise Jehovah according to his righteousness, and  will sing forth the name of Jehovah the Most High.
