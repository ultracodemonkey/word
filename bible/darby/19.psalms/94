O ùGod of vengeances, Jehovah, ùGod of vengeances, shine  forth;
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth, render the reward  to the proud.
How long shall the wicked, O Jehovah, how long shall the  wicked triumph?
\How long\ shall they utter \and\ speak insolence -- all  the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
They crush thy people, O Jehovah, and afflict thine  inheritance;
They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the  fatherless,
And say, Jah will not see, neither will the God of Jacob  regard \it\.
Understand, ye brutish among the people; and ye fools, when  will ye be wise?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed  the eye, shall he not see?
He that instructeth the nations, shall not he correct --  he that teacheth man knowledge?
Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jah, and whom  thou teachest out of thy law;
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil,  until the pit be digged for the wicked.
For Jehovah will not cast off his people, neither will he  forsake his inheritance;
For judgment shall return unto righteousness, and all the  upright in heart shall follow it.
Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? who will  stand for me against the workers of iniquity?
If Jehovah had not been my help, my soul had almost dwelt  in silence.
When I said, My foot slippeth, thy loving-kindness, O  Jehovah, held me up.
In the multitude of my anxious thoughts within me thy  comforts have delighted my soul.
Shall the throne of wickedness be united to thee, which  frameth mischief into a law?
They band together against the soul of the righteous, and  condemn innocent blood.
But Jehovah will be my high tower; and my God the rock of  my refuge.
And he will bring upon them their iniquity, and will cut  them off in their own evil: Jehovah our God will cut them off.
