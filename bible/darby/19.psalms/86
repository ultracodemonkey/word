{A Prayer of David.} <BR>Incline thine ear, Jehovah, answer me;  for I am afflicted and needy.
Keep my soul, for I am godly; O thou my God, save thy  servant who confideth in thee.
Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto thee do I call all  the day.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, Lord, do I  lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, and art of  great loving-kindness unto all that call upon thee.
Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer, and attend to the  voice of my supplications.
In the day of my distress I will call upon thee, for thou  wilt answer me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, Lord, and  there is nothing like unto thy works.
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship  before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art  God, thou alone.
Teach me thy way, Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth: unite  my heart to fear thy name.
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart;  and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
For great is thy loving-kindness toward me, and thou hast  delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assembly of  the violent seek after my soul, and they have not set thee  before them.
But thou, Lord, art a ùGod merciful and gracious, slow to  anger, and abundant in goodness and truth.
Turn toward me, and be gracious unto me; give thy strength  unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
Shew me a token for good, that they which hate me may see  it, and be ashamed; for thou, Jehovah, hast helped me and  comforted me.
