Why are the nations in tumultuous agitation, and \why\ do  the peoples meditate a vain thing?
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the princes plot  together, against Jehovah and against his anointed:
Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords  from us!
He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall  have them in derision.
Then will he speak to them in his anger, and in his fierce  displeasure will he terrify them:
And *I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my  holiness.
I will declare the decree: Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou  art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee.
Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance,  and for thy possession the ends of the earth:
Thou shalt break them with a sceptre of iron, as a potter`s  vessel thou shalt dash them in pieces.
And now, O kings, be ye wise, be admonished, ye judges of  the earth.
Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way,  though his anger burn but a little. Blessed are all who have  their trust in him.
