{A Song of degrees.} Many a time have they afflicted me  from my youth -- oh let Israel say --
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth; yet they  have not prevailed against me.
The ploughers ploughed upon my back; they made long their  furrows.
Jehovah is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the  wicked.
Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all that hate  Zion;
Let them be as the grass upon the house-tops, which  withereth before it is plucked up,
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that  bindeth sheaves his bosom;
Neither do the passers-by say, The blessing of Jehovah be  upon you; we bless you in the name of Jehovah!
