{To the chief Musician. \A Psalm\ of the servant of  Jehovah; of David.} 
The transgression of the wicked uttereth  within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, \even\ when his  iniquity is found to be hateful.
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit: he hath  left off to be wise, to do good.
He deviseth wickedness up on his bed; he setteth himself in  a way that is not good: he abhorreth not evil.
Jehovah, thy loving-kindness is in the heavens, and thy  faithfulness \reacheth\ unto the clouds.
Thy righteousness is like the high mountains; thy judgments  are a great deep: thou, Jehovah, preservest man and beast.
How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! So the sons of  men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy  house; and thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy  pleasures.
For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall  we see light.
Continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, and  thy righteousness to the upright in heart;
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the  hand of the wicked drive me away.
There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast  down, and are not able to rise.
