{Michtam of David.} Preserve me, O ùGod: for I trust in  thee.
Thou \my soul\ hast said to Jehovah, Thou art the Lord: my  goodness \extendeth\ not to thee; --
To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent  \thou hast said\, In them is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after  another: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, and I  will not take up their names into my lips.
Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:  thou maintainest my lot.
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I  have a goodly heritage.
I will bless Jehovah, who giveth me counsel; even in the  nights my reins instruct me.
I have set Jehovah continually before me; because \he is\  at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart rejoiceth, and my glory exulteth; my  flesh moreover shall dwell in hope.
For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol, neither wilt  thou allow thy Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt make known to me the path of life: thy  countenance is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures  for evermore.
