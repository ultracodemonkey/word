{A Song of degrees.} In my trouble I called unto Jehovah,  and he answered me.
Jehovah, deliver my soul from the lying lip, from the  deceitful tongue.
What shall be given unto thee, what shall be added unto  thee, thou deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with burning coals of  broom-wood.
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among  the tents of Kedar!
My soul hath long dwelt with them that hate peace.
I \am for\ peace; but when I speak, *they* \are\ for war.
