{To the chief Musician. On Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.}  
Upon God alone doth my soul rest peacefully; from him is my  salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation; my high fortress: I  shall not be greatly moved.
How long will ye assail a man; will ye \seek\, all of you,  to break him down as a bowing wall or a tottering fence?
They only consult to thrust \him\ down from his excellency;  they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but in their  inward part they curse. Selah.
Upon God alone, O my soul, rest peacefully; for my  expectation is from him.
He only is my rock and my salvation; my high fortress: I  shall not be moved.
With God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my  strength, my refuge is in God.
Confide in him at all times, ye people; pour out your heart  before him: God is our refuge. Selah.
Men of low degree are only vanity; men of high degree, a  lie: laid in the balance, they go up together \lighter\ than  vanity.
Put not confidence in oppression, and become not vain in  robbery; if wealth increase, set not your heart upon it.
Once hath God spoken, twice have I heard this, that  strength \belongeth\ unto God.
And unto thee, O Lord, \belongeth\ loving-kindness; for  *thou* renderest to every man according to his work.
