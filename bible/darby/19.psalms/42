{To the chief Musician. An instruction; of the sons of  Korah.} 
As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth  my soul after thee, O God.
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living ùGod: when shall  I come and appear before God?
My tears have been my bread day and night, while they say  unto me all the day, Where is thy God?
These things I remember and have poured out my soul within  me: how I passed along with the multitude, how I went on with  them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a  festive multitude.
Why art thou cast down, my soul, and art disquieted in me?  hope in God; for I shall yet praise him, \for\ the health of  his countenance.
My God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore do I  remember thee from the land of the Jordan, and the Hermons,  from mount Mizar.
Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy cataracts; all  thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me.
In the day-time will Jehovah command his loving-kindness,  and in the night his song shall be with me, a prayer unto the  ùGod of my life.
I will say unto ùGod my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?  why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
As with a crushing in my bones mine adversaries reproach  me, while they say unto me all the day, Where is thy God?
Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou  disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise him,  \who is\ the health of my countenance, and my God.
