{Of David. A Psalm.} The earth is Jehovah`s, and the  fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
For it was he that founded it upon seas, and established it  upon floods.
Who shall ascend into the mount of Jehovah? and who shall  stand in his holy place?
He that hath blameless hands and a pure heart; who lifteth  not up his soul unto vanity, nor sweareth deceitfully:
He shall receive blessing from Jehovah, and righteousness  from the God of his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek unto him, that  seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye  everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.
Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty,  Jehovah mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, ye gates; yea, lift up, ye everlasting  doors, and the King of glory shall come in.
Who is he, this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, he is the  King of glory. Selah.
