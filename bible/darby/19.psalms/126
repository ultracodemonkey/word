{A Song of degrees.} When Jehovah turned the captivity of  Zion, we were like them that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue  with rejoicing: then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath  done great things for them.
Jehovah hath done great things for us; \and\ we are  joyful.
Turn our captivity, O Jehovah, as the streams in the  south.
They that sow in tears shall reap with rejoicing:
He goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for scattering;  he cometh again with rejoicing, bearing his sheaves.
