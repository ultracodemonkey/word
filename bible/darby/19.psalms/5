{To the chief Musician. Upon Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.}  
Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my meditation.
Hearken unto the voice of my crying, my king and my God; for  to thee will I pray.
Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the  morning will I address myself to thee, and will look up.
For thou art not a ùGod that hath pleasure in wickedness;  evil shall not sojourn with thee.
Insolent fools shall not stand before thine eyes; thou  hatest all workers of iniquity.
Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth a  man of blood and deceit.
But as for me, in the greatness of thy loving-kindness will  I enter thy house; I will bow down toward the temple of thy  holiness in thy fear.
Lead me, Jehovah, in thy righteousness, because of my foes;  make thy way plain before me.
For there is no certainty in their mouth; their inward part  is perversion, their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter  with their tongue.
Bring guilt upon them, O God; let them fall by their own  counsels: drive them out in the multitude of their  transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee.
And all that trust in thee shall rejoice: for ever shall  they shout joyously, and thou wilt protect them; and they that  love thy name shall exult in thee.
For thou, Jehovah, wilt bless the righteous \man\; with  favour wilt thou surround him as \with\ a shield.
