{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} 
Blessed is he  that understandeth the poor: Jehovah will deliver him in the  day of evil.
Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive; he shall be  made happy in the land; and thou wilt not deliver him to the  will of his enemies.
Jehovah will sustain him upon the bed of languishing: thou  turnest all his bed in his sickness.
As for me, I said, Jehovah, be gracious unto me: heal my  soul; for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies wish me evil: When will he die, and his name  perish?
And if one come to see \me\, he speaketh falsehood; his  heart gathereth wickedness to itself: he goeth abroad, he  telleth \it\.
All that hate me whisper together against me; against me do  they devise my hurt.
A thing of Belial cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he  is laid down, he will rise up no more.
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I confided, who did  eat of my bread, hath lifted up \his\ heel against me.
But thou, Jehovah, be gracious unto me, and raise me up,  that I may requite them.
By this I know that thou delightest in me, because mine  enemy doth not triumph over me.
But as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and  settest me before thy face for ever.
Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from eternity to  eternity! Amen, and Amen.
