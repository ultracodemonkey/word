{To the chief Musician. `Destroy not.` A Psalm of Asaph: a  Song.} 
Unto thee we give thanks, O God, we give thanks; and thy  name is near: thy marvellous works declare it.
When I shall receive the assembly, I will judge with  equity.
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I  have established its pillars. Selah.
I said unto the boastful, Boast not; and to the wicked,  Lift not up the horn:
Lift not up your horn on high; speak not arrogantly with a  \stiff\ neck.
For not from the east nor from the west, nor yet from the  south doth exaltation \come\:
For God is the judge; he putteth down one and exalteth  another.
For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and it foameth  with wine, it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the  same; yea, the dregs thereof shall all the wicked of the earth  drain off, \and\ drink.
But as for me, I will declare for ever; I will sing psalms  to the God of Jacob.
And all the horns of the wicked will I cut off; \but\ the  horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
