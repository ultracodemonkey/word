{To the chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm of  Asaph: a Song.} 
In Judah is God known, his name is great in  Israel;
And in Salem is his tent, and his dwelling-place in Zion.
There broke he the flashings of the bow, shield and sword  and battle. Selah.
More glorious art thou, more excellent, than the mountains  of prey.
The stout-hearted are made a spoil, they have slept their  sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are  cast into a dead sleep.
Thou, thou art to be feared, and who can stand before thee  when once thou art angry?
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from the heavens; the  earth feared, and was still,
When God rose up to judgment, to save all the meek of the  earth. Selah.
For the fury of man shall praise thee; the remainder of  fury wilt thou gird on thyself.
Vow and pay unto Jehovah your God: let all that are round  about him bring presents unto him that is to be feared.
He cutteth off the spirit of princes; \he\ is terrible to  the kings of the earth.
