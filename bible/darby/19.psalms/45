{To the chief Musician. Upon Shoshannim. Of the sons of  Korah. An instruction; -- a song of the Beloved.} 
My heart is  welling forth \with\ a good matter: I say what I have composed  touching the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the sons of men; grace is poured into  thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thy sword upon \thy\ thigh, O mighty one, \in\ thy  majesty and thy splendour;
And \in\ thy splendour ride prosperously, because of truth  and meekness \and\ righteousness: and thy right hand shall  teach thee terrible things.
Thine arrows are sharp -- peoples fall under thee -- in the  heart of the king`s enemies.
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of  uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom:
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness;  therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of  gladness above thy companions.
Myrrh and aloes, cassia, are all thy garments; out of ivory  palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
Kings` daughters are among thine honourable women; upon thy  right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
Hearken, daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; and  forget thine own people and thy father`s house:
And the king will desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord,  and worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre with a gift, the rich ones among  the people, shall court thy favour.
All glorious is the king`s daughter within; her clothing  is of wrought gold:
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of  embroidery; the virgins behind her, her companions, shall be  brought in unto thee:
With joy and gladness shall they be brought; they shall  enter into the king`s palace.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons; princes shalt  thou make them in all the earth.
I will make thy name to be remembered throughout all  generations; therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever  and ever.
