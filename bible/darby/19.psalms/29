{A Psalm of David.} Give unto Jehovah, ye sons of the  mighty ones, give unto Jehovah glory and strength;
Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name; worship Jehovah in  holy splendour.
The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: the ùGod of glory  thundereth, -- Jehovah upon great waters.
The voice of Jehovah is powerful; the voice of Jehovah is  full of majesty.
The voice of Jehovah breaketh cedars; yea, Jehovah breaketh  the cedars of Lebanon:
And he maketh them to skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion  like a young buffalo.
The voice of Jehovah cleaveth out flames of fire.
The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah  shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, and layeth  bare the forests; and in his temple doth every one say, Glory!
Jehovah sitteth upon the flood; yea, Jehovah sitteth as  king for ever.
Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will  bless his people with peace.
