{A Song of degrees.} Blessed is every one that feareth  Jehovah, that walketh in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labour of thy hands; happy shalt  thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the inner part of  thy house; thy children like olive-plants round about thy  table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth  Jehovah.
Jehovah will bless thee out of Zion; and mayest thou see  the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life,
And see thy children`s children. Peace be upon Israel!
