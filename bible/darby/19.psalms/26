{\A Psalm\ of David.} Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have  walked in mine integrity, and I have confided in Jehovah: I  shall not slip.
Prove me, Jehovah, and test me; try my reins and my heart:
For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes, and I have  walked in thy truth.
I have not sat with vain persons, neither have I gone in  with dissemblers;
I have hated the congregation of evil-doers, and I have not  sat with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocency, and will encompass thine  altar, O Jehovah,
That I may cause the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and  declare all thy marvellous works.
Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the  place where thy glory dwelleth.
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of  blood;
In whose hands are evil devices, and their right hand is  full of bribes.
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity. Redeem me,  and be gracious unto me.
My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations  will I bless Jehovah.
