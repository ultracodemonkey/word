{To the chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm.} 
All ye peoples, clap your hands; shout unto God with the voice of  triumph!
For Jehovah, the Most High, is terrible, a great king over  all the earth.
He subdueth the peoples under us, and the nations under our  feet.
He hath chosen our inheritance for us, the excellency of  Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
God is gone up amid shouting, Jehovah amid the sound of the  trumpet.
Sing psalms of God, sing psalms; sing psalms unto our King,  sing psalms!
For God is the King of all the earth; sing psalms with  understanding.
God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon the throne  of his holiness.
The willing-hearted of the peoples have gathered together,  \with\ the people of the God of Abraham. For unto God \belong\  the shields of the earth: he is greatly exalted.
