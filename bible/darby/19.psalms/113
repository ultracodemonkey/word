Hallelujah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah, praise the  name of Jehovah.
Blessed be the name of Jehovah, from this time forth and  for evermore!
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the  same, let Jehovah`s name be praised.
Jehovah is high above all nations, his glory above the  heavens.
Who is like unto Jehovah our God, who hath placed his  dwelling on high;
Who humbleth himself to look on the heavens and on the  earth?
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill  he lifteth up the needy,
To set \him\ among nobles, among the nobles of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house, \as\ a joyful  mother of sons. Hallelujah!
