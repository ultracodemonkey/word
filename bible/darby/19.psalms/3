{A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.}  
Jehovah, how many are they that trouble me, many they that rise  up against me!
Many say of my soul, There is no salvation for him in God.  Selah.
But thou, Jehovah, art a shield about me; my glory, and the  lifter up of my head.
With my voice will I call to Jehovah, and he will answer me  from the hill of his holiness. Selah.
I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for Jehovah sustaineth  me.
I will not fear for myriads of the people that have set  themselves against me round about.
Arise, Jehovah; save me, my God! For thou hast smitten all  mine enemies upon the cheekbone, thou hast broken the teeth of  the wicked.
Salvation is of Jehovah; thy blessing is upon thy people.  Selah.
