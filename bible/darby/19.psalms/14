{To the chief Musician. \A Psalm\ of David.} The fool hath  said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted  themselves, they have done abominable works: there is none that  doeth good.
Jehovah looked down from the heavens upon the children of  men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did  seek God.
They have all gone aside, they are together become corrupt:  there is none that doeth good, not even one.
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, eating up my  people \as\ they eat bread? They call not upon Jehovah.
There were they in great fear; for God is in the generation  of the righteous.
Ye have shamed the counsel of the afflicted, because  Jehovah \was\ his refuge.
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When  Jehovah turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob shall  be glad, Israel shall rejoice.
