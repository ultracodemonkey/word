{To the chief Musician. A Song: a Psalm.} Shout aloud unto  God, all the earth:
Sing forth the glory of his name, make his praise glorious;
Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! because of the  greatness of thy strength, thine enemies come cringing unto  thee.
All the earth shall worship thee, and sing psalms unto  thee: they shall sing forth thy name. Selah.
Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in \his\  doings toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry \land\; they went through the  river on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes observe the  nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
Bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise  to be heard;
Who hath set our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet  to be moved.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as  silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into a net, thou didst lay a heavy  burden upon our loins;
Thou didst cause men to ride over our head; we went  through fire and through water: but thou hast brought us out  into abundance.
I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will  perform my vows to thee,
Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when  I was in trouble.
I will offer up unto thee burnt-offerings of fatted  beasts, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with  goats. Selah.
Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what  he hath done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with  my tongue.
Had I regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not  hear.
But God hath heard; he hath attended to the voice of my  prayer.
Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor  his loving-kindness from me!
