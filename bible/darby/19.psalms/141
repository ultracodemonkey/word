{A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, I have called upon thee: make  haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, the  lifting up of my hands as the evening oblation.
Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; keep the door of  my lips.
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise deeds  of wickedness with men that are workers of iniquity; and let me  not eat of their dainties.
Let the righteous smite me, it is kindness; and let him  reprove me, it is an excellent oil which my head shall not  refuse: for yet my prayer also is \for them\ in their  calamities.
When their judges are thrown down from the rocks, they  shall hear my words, for they are sweet.
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol, as when one  cutteth and cleaveth \wood\ upon the earth.
For unto thee, Jehovah, Lord, are mine eyes; in thee do I  trust: leave not my soul destitute.
Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and  from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that *I*  withal pass over.
