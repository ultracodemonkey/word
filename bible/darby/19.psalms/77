{To the chief Musician. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A Psalm.} 
My voice is unto God, and I will cry; my voice is unto God, and he  will give ear unto me.
In the day of my trouble, I sought the Lord: my hand was  stretched out in the night, and slacked not; my soul refused to  be comforted.
I remembered God, and I moaned; I complained, and my spirit  was overwhelmed. Selah.
Thou holdest open mine eyelids; I am full of disquiet and  cannot speak.
I consider the days of old, the years of ancient times.
I remember my song in the night; I muse in mine own heart,  and my spirit maketh diligent search.
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable  no more?
Hath his loving-kindness ceased for ever? hath \his\ word  come to an end from generation to generation?
Hath ùGod forgotten to be gracious? or hath he in anger  shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
Then said I, This is my weakness: -- the years of the  right hand of the Most High
Will I remember, -- the works of Jah; for I will remember  thy wonders of old,
And I will meditate upon all thy work, and muse upon thy  doings.
O God, thy way is in the sanctuary: who is so great a ùgod  as God?
Thou art the ùGod that doest wonders; thou hast declared  thy strength among the peoples.
Thou hast with \thine\ arm redeemed thy people, the sons  of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they  trembled, yea, the depths were troubled:
The thick clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a  sound, yea, thine arrows went abroad:
The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind, lightnings  lit up the world; the earth was troubled and it quaked.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths are in the great  waters; and thy footsteps are not known.
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses  and Aaron.
