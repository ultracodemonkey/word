{To the chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm: a  Song.} 
God be gracious unto us, and bless us, \and\ cause his  face to shine upon us; Selah,
That thy way may be known upon earth, thy salvation among  all nations.
Let the peoples praise thee, O God, let all the peoples  praise thee.
Let the nations rejoice and sing for joy: for thou wilt  judge the peoples equitably; and the nations upon earth, thou  wilt guide them. Selah.
Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples  praise thee.
The earth will yield her increase; God, our God, will bless  us:
God will bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear  him.
