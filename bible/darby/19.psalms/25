{\A Psalm\ of David.} Unto thee, Jehovah, do I lift up my  soul.
My God, I confide in thee; let me not be ashamed, let not  mine enemies triumph over me.
Yea, none that wait on thee shall be ashamed: they shall be  ashamed that deal treacherously without cause.
Make me to know thy ways, O Jehovah; teach me thy paths.
Make me to walk in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art  the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
Remember, Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy  loving-kindnesses; for they are from everlasting.
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions;  according to thy loving-kindness remember thou me, for thy  goodness` sake, Jehovah.
Good and upright is Jehovah; therefore will he instruct  sinners in the way:
The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he  teach his way.
All the paths of Jehovah are loving-kindness and truth for  such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
For thy name`s sake, O Jehovah, thou wilt indeed pardon  mine iniquity; for it is great.
What man is he that feareth Jehovah? him will he instruct  in the way \that\ he should choose.
His soul shall dwell in prosperity, and his seed shall  inherit the earth.
The secret of Jehovah is with them that fear him, that he  may make known his covenant to them.
Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; for he will bring my  feet out of the net.
Turn toward me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary  and afflicted.
The troubles of my heart are increased: bring me out of my  distresses;
Consider mine affliction and my travail, and forgive all  my sins.
Consider mine enemies, for they are many, and they hate me  \with\ cruel hatred.
Keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I  trust in thee.
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on  thee.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
