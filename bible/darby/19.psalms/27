{\A Psalm\ of David.} Jehovah is my light and my salvation;  whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; of whom  shall I be afraid?
When evil-doers, mine adversaries and mine enemies, came  upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
If a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; if  war rise against me, in this will I be confident.
One \thing\ have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek  after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of  my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire \of  him\ in his temple.
For in the day of evil he will hide me in his pavilion; in  the secret of his tent will he keep me concealed: he will set  me high upon a rock.
And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round  about me; and I will offer in his tent sacrifices of shouts of  joy: I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms unto Jehovah.
Hear, Jehovah; with my voice do I call; be gracious unto  me, and answer me.
My heart said for thee, Seek ye my face. Thy face, O  Jehovah, will I seek.
Hide not thy face from me; put not thy servant away in  anger: thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake  me, O God of my salvation.
For had my father and my mother forsaken me, then had  Jehovah taken me up.
Teach me thy way, Jehovah, and lead me in an even path,  because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over to the will of mine adversaries; for  false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe  out violence.
Unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah in  the land of the living ...!
Wait for Jehovah; be strong and let thy heart take  courage: yea, wait for Jehovah.
