Jehovah reigneth, he hath clothed himself with majesty:  Jehovah hath clothed himself, he hath girded himself with  strength; yea, the world is established, it shall not be moved.
Thy throne is established of old; thou art from eternity.
The floods lifted up, O Jehovah, the floods lifted up their  voice; the floods lifted up their roaring waves.
Jehovah on high is mightier than the voices of many waters,  than the mighty breakers of the sea.
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thy house,  O Jehovah, for ever.
