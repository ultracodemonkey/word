{To the chief Musician: an instruction. Of David; when Doeg  the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David came  to the house of Ahimelech.} 
Why boastest thou thyself in evil,  thou mighty man? The loving-kindness of ùGod \abideth\  continually.
Thy tongue deviseth mischievous things, like a sharp razor,  practising deceit.
Thou hast loved evil rather than good, lying rather than to  speak righteousness. Selah.
Thou hast loved all devouring words, O deceitful tongue!
ùGod shall likewise destroy thee for ever; he shall take  thee away, and pluck thee out of \thy\ tent, and root thee out  of the land of the living. Selah.
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at  him, \saying,\
Behold the man that made not God his strength, but put  confidence in the abundance of his riches, \and\ strengthened  himself in his avarice.
But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of  God: I will confide in the loving-kindness of God for ever and  ever.
I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done \it\;  and I will wait on thy name, before thy godly ones, for it is  good.
