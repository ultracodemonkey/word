{To the chief Musician. On stringed instruments, upon  Sheminith. A Psalm of David.} 
Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine  anger, and chasten me not in thy hot displeasure.
Be gracious unto me, Jehovah, for I am withered; Jehovah,  heal me, for my bones tremble.
And my soul trembleth exceedingly: and thou, Jehovah, till  how long?
Return, Jehovah, free my soul; save me for thy  loving-kindness` sake.
For in death there is no remembrance of thee; in Sheol who  shall give thanks unto thee?
I am wearied with my groaning; all the night make I my bed  to swim; I dissolve my couch with my tears.
Mine eye wasteth away through grief; it hath grown old  because of all mine oppressors.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for Jehovah hath  heard the voice of my weeping.
Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah receiveth my  prayer.
All mine enemies shall be ashamed and tremble exceedingly;  they will turn, they will be ashamed suddenly.
