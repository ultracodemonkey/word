{A Prayer of David.} Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto  my cry; give ear unto my prayer, which is not out of feigned  lips.
Let my judgment come forth from thy presence, let thine  eyes regard equity.
Thou hast proved my heart, thou hast visited me by night;  thou hast tried me, thou hast found nothing: my thought goeth  not beyond my word.
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have  kept from the paths of the violent \man\.
When thou holdest my goings in thy paths, my footsteps slip  not.
I have called upon thee, for thou answerest me, O ùGod.  Incline thine ear unto me, hear my speech.
Shew wondrously thy loving-kindnesses, O thou that savest  by thy right hand them that trust \in thee\ from those that  rise up \against them\.
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow  of thy wings,
From the wicked that destroy me, my deadly enemies, who  compass me about.
They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouth they  speak proudly.
They have now encompassed us in our steps; their eyes have  they set, bowing down to the earth.
He is like a lion that is greedy of its prey, and as a  young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, Jehovah, anticipate him, cast him down: deliver my  soul from the wicked, thy sword;
From men \who are\ thy hand, O Jehovah, from men of this  age: their portion is in \this\ life, and their belly thou  fillest with thy hid \treasure\; they have their fill of sons,  and leave the rest of their \substance\ to their children.
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I  shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
