I love Jehovah, for he hath heard my voice \and\ my  supplications;
For he hath inclined his ear unto me, and I will call upon  him during \all\ my days.
The bands of death encompassed me, and the anguish of  Sheol took hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow:
Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: I beseech thee,  Jehovah, deliver my soul.
Gracious is Jehovah and righteous; and our God is  merciful.
Jehovah keepeth the simple: I was brought low, and he  saved me.
Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for Jehovah hath dealt  bountifully with thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from  tears, my feet from falling.
I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore have I spoken. As for me, I was  greatly afflicted.
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I render unto Jehovah, \for\ all his benefits  toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name  of Jehovah.
I will perform my vows unto Jehovah, yea, before all his  people.
Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of his  saints.
Yea, Jehovah! for I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the  son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and  will call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will perform my vows unto Jehovah, yea, before all his  people,
In the courts of Jehovah`s house, in the midst of thee, O  Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
