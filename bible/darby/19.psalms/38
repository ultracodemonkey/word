{A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.} 
Jehovah,  rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot  displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand cometh down  upon me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine  indignation; no peace in my bones, because of my sin.
For mine iniquities are gone over my head: as a heavy  burden they are too heavy for me.
My wounds stink, they are corrupt, because of my  foolishness.
I am depressed; I am bowed down beyond measure; I go  mourning all the day.
For my loins are full of burning, and there is no soundness  in my flesh.
I am faint and broken beyond measure; I roar by reason of  the agitation of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my sighing is not  hid from thee.
My heart throbbeth, my strength hath left me; and the  light of mine eyes, it also is no more with me.
My lovers and mine associates stand aloof from my stroke;  and my kinsmen stand afar off.
And they that seek after my life lay snares \for me\; and  they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate  deceits all the day long.
But I, as a deaf \man\, hear not; and am as a dumb man  that openeth not his mouth.
Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth  are no reproofs.
For in thee, Jehovah, do I hope: *thou* wilt answer, O  Lord my God.
For I said, Let them not rejoice over me! When my foot  slipped, they magnified \themselves\ against me.
For I am ready to halt, and my pain is continually before  me.
For I will declare mine iniquity, I am grieved for my sin.
But mine enemies are lively, they are strong; and they  that hate me wrongfully are multiplied:
And they that render evil for good are adversaries unto  me; because I pursue what is good.
Forsake me not, Jehovah; O my God, be not far from me.
Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
