Jehovah reigneth: let the earth be glad, let the many isles  rejoice.
Clouds and darkness are round about him; righteousness and  judgment are the foundation of his throne.
A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his adversaries  round about.
His lightnings lightened the world: the earth saw, and  trembled.
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah,  at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples  see his glory.
Ashamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast  themselves of idols. Worship him, all ye gods.
Zion heard, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah were  glad, because of thy judgments, O Jehovah.
For thou, Jehovah, art the Most High above all the earth;  thou art exalted exceedingly above all gods.
Ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: he preserveth the souls  of his saints, he delivereth them out of the hand of the  wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright  in heart.
Rejoice in Jehovah, ye righteous; and give thanks in  remembrance of his holiness.
