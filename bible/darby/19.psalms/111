Hallelujah! I will celebrate Jehovah with \my\ whole  heart, in the council of the upright, and in the assembly.
Great are the works of Jehovah; sought out of all that  delight in them.
His work is majesty and splendour, and his righteousness  abideth for ever.
He hath made his wonders to be remembered: Jehovah is  gracious and merciful.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he is ever  mindful of his covenant.
He hath shewn his people the power of his works, to give  them the heritage of the nations.
The works of his hands are truth and judgment; all his  precepts are faithful:
Maintained for ever and ever, done in truth and  uprightness.
He sent deliverance unto his people; he hath commanded his  covenant for ever: holy and terrible is his name.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good  understanding have all they that do \his precepts\: his praise  abideth for ever.
