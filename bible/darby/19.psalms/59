{To the chief Musician. `Destroy not.` Of David. Michtam;  when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.}  
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God; secure me on high from  them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from  men of blood.
For behold, they lie in wait for my soul; strong ones are  gathered against me: not for my transgression, nor for my sin,  O Jehovah.
They run and prepare themselves without \my\ fault: awake  to meet me, and behold.
Yea, do thou, Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel,  arise to visit all the nations: be not gracious to any plotters  of iniquity. Selah.
They return in the evening; they howl like a dog, and go  round about the city:
Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in  their lips: for who \say they\ doth hear?
But thou, Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; thou wilt have all  the nations in derision.
Their strength! ... I will take heed to thee; for God is my  high fortress.
God, whose loving-kindness will come to meet me, -- God  shall let me see \my desire\ upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget; by thy power make  them wander, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
\Because of\ the sin of their mouth, the word of their  lips, let them even be taken in their pride; and because of  cursing and lying which they speak.
Make an end in wrath, make an end, that they may be no  more; that they may know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the  ends of the earth. Selah.
And in the evening they shall return, they shall howl like  a dog, and go round about the city.
They shall wander about for meat, and stay all night if  they be not satisfied.
But as for me, I will sing of thy strength; yea, I will  sing aloud of thy loving-kindness in the morning; for thou hast  been to me a high fortress, and a refuge in the day of my  trouble.
Unto thee, my strength, will I sing psalms; for God is my  high fortress, the God of my mercy.
