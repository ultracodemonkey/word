{To the chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm.}  
Thou hast been favourable, Jehovah, unto thy land; thou hast  turned the captivity of Jacob:
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; thou hast  covered all their sin. Selah.
Thou hast withdrawn all thy wrath; thou hast turned from  the fierceness of thine anger.
Bring us back, O God of our salvation, and cause thine  indignation toward us to cease.
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out  thine anger from generation to generation?
Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice  in thee?
Shew us thy loving-kindness, O Jehovah, and grant us thy  salvation.
I will hear what ùGod, Jehovah, will speak; for he will  speak peace unto his people, and to his godly ones: but let  them not turn again to folly.
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, that glory  may dwell in our land.
Loving-kindness and truth are met together; righteousness  and peace have kissed each other:
Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness  shall look down from the heavens.
Jehovah also will give what is good, and our land shall  yield its increase.
Righteousness shall go before him, and shall set his  footsteps on the way.
