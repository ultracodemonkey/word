{A Psalm, a Song, for the Sabbath day.} 
It is good to give  thanks unto Jehovah, and to sing psalms unto thy name, O Most  High;
To declare thy loving-kindness in the morning, and thy  faithfulness in the nights,
Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the lute; upon  the Higgaion with the harp.
For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work; I  will triumph in the works of thy hands.
Jehovah, how great are thy works! Thy thoughts are very  deep:
A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand  it.
When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the  workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they may be destroyed  for ever.
And thou, Jehovah, art on high for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, for lo, thine enemies  shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn shalt thou exalt like a buffalo`s: I shall be  anointed with fresh oil.
And mine eye shall see \its desire\ on mine enemies; mine  ears shall hear \it\ of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
The righteous shall shoot forth like a palm-tree; he shall  grow like a cedar on Lebanon.
Those that are planted in the house of Jehovah shall  flourish in the courts of our God:
They are still vigorous in old age, they are full of sap  and green;
To shew that Jehovah is upright: \he is\ my rock, and  there is no unrighteousness in him.
