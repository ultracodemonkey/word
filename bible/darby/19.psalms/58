{To the chief Musician. `Destroy not.` Of David. Michtam.}  
Is righteousness indeed silent? Do ye speak it? Do ye judge  with equity, ye sons of men?
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out the violence  of your hands in the earth.
The wicked go astray from the womb; they err as soon as  they are born, speaking lies.
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: \they are\  like the deaf adder which stoppeth her ear;
Which doth not hearken to the voice of enchanters, of one  charming ever so wisely.
O God, break their teeth in their mouth; break out the  great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.
Let them melt away as waters that flow off; when he aimeth  his arrows, let them be as blunted:
Let them be as a snail that melteth as it passeth away;  \like\ the untimely birth of a woman, let them not see the sun.
Before your pots feel the thorns, green or burning, -- they  shall be whirled away.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance;  he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the wicked:
And men shall say, Verily there is fruit for the  righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.
