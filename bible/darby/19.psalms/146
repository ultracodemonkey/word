Hallelujah! Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
As long as I live will I praise Jehovah; I will sing  psalms unto my God while I have my being.
Put not confidence in nobles, in a son of man, in whom  there is no salvation.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that  very day his purposes perish.
Blessed is he who hath the ùGod of Jacob for his help,  whose hope is in Jehovah his God,
Who made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that  is therein; who keepeth truth for ever;
Who executeth judgment for the oppressed, who giveth bread  to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners;
Jehovah openeth \the eyes of\ the blind; Jehovah raiseth  up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous;
Jehovah preserveth the strangers; he lifteth up the  fatherless and the widow; but the way of the wicked doth he  subvert.
Jehovah will reign for ever, \even\ thy God, O Zion, from  generation to generation. Halleluiah!
