Hallelujah! Sing unto Jehovah a new song; \sing\ his  praise in the congregation of the godly.
Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the sons of Zion be  joyful in their King.
Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing  psalms unto him with the tambour and harp.
For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people; he beautifieth  the meek with salvation.
Let the godly exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon  their beds.
Let the high praises of ùGod be in their mouth, and a  two-edged sword in their hand:
To execute vengeance against the nations, \and\ punishment  among the peoples;
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with  fetters of iron;
To execute upon them the judgment written. This honour  have all his saints. Hallelujah!
