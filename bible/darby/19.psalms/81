{To the chief Musician. Upon the Gittith. \A Psalm\ of  Asaph.} 
Sing ye joyously unto God our strength, shout aloud  unto the God of Jacob;
Raise a song, and sound the tambour, the pleasant harp with  the lute.
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the set time, on our  feast day:
For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God  of Jacob;
He ordained it in Joseph \for\ a testimony, when he went  forth over the land of Egypt, \where\ I heard a language that I  knew not.
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were  freed from the basket.
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered  thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the  waters of Meribah. Selah.
Hear, my people, and I will testify unto thee; O Israel, if  thou wouldest hearken unto me!
There shall no strange ùgod be in thee, neither shalt thou  worship any foreign ùgod.
I am Jehovah thy God, that brought thee up out of the land  of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But my people hearkened not to my voice, and Israel would  none of me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts` stubbornness:  they walked after their own counsels.
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, that Israel had  walked in my ways!
I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my  hand against their adversaries.
The haters of Jehovah would have come cringing unto him;  but their time would have been for ever.
And he would have fed them with the finest of wheat; yea,  with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied thee.
