{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} How long,  Jehovah, wilt thou forget me for ever? how long wilt thou hide  thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, with sorrow in my  heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Consider, answer me, O Jehovah my God! lighten mine eyes,  lest I sleep the \sleep of\ death;
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him! \lest\  mine adversaries be joyful when I am moved.
As for me, I have confided in thy loving-kindness; my heart  shall be joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath dealt bountifully  with me.
