{A Song; a Psalm. Of the sons of Korah.} 
Great is Jehovah,  and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the hill  of his holiness.
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is  mount Zion, \on\ the sides of the north, the city of the great  King.
God is known in her palaces as a high fortress.
For behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by  together;
They saw, -- so they marvelled; they were troubled, they  fled in consternation:
Trembling took hold upon them there; anguish, as of a woman  in travail.
With an east wind thou hast broken the ships of Tarshish.
As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of Jehovah  of hosts, in the city of our God: God doth establish it for  ever. Selah.
We have thought, O God, of thy loving-kindness, in the  midst of thy temple.
According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the  ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be  glad, because of thy judgments.
Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers  thereof;
Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces: that ye  may tell it to the generation following.
For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our  guide until death.
