He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall  abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
I say of Jehovah, My refuge and my fortress; my God, I will  confide in him.
Surely *he* shall deliver thee from the snare of the  fowler, \and\ from the destructive pestilence.
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings  shalt thou find refuge: his truth is a shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, for the  arrow that flieth by day,
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, for the  destruction that wasteth at noonday.
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy  right hand; \but\ it shall not come nigh thee.
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward  of the wicked.
Because *thou* hast made Jehovah, my refuge, the Most High,  thy dwelling-place,
There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague  come nigh thy tent.
For he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to  keep thee in all thy ways:
They shall bear thee up in \their\ hands, lest thou dash  thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; the young  lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I  deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known my  name.
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be  with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honour him.
With length of days will I satisfy him, and shew him my  salvation.
