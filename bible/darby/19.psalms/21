{To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.} 
The king shall  joy in thy strength, Jehovah; and in thy salvation how greatly  shall he rejoice.
Thou hast given him his heart`s desire, and hast not  withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
For thou hast met him with the blessings of goodness; thou  hast set a crown of pure gold on his head.
He asked life of thee; thou gavest \it\ him, length of days  for ever and ever.
His glory is great through thy salvation; majesty and  splendour hast thou laid upon him.
For thou hast made him to be blessings for ever; thou hast  filled him with joy by thy countenance.
For the king confideth in Jehovah: and through the  loving-kindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
Thy hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand  shall find out those that hate thee.
Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thy  presence; Jehovah shall swallow them up in his anger, and the  fire shall devour them:
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their  seed from among the children of men.
For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a  mischievous device, which they could not execute.
For thou wilt make them turn their back; thou wilt make  ready thy bowstring against their face.
Be thou exalted, Jehovah, in thine own strength: we will  sing and celebrate thy power.
