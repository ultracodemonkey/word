{To the chief Musician. Upon the Gittith. Of the sons of  Korah. A Psalm.} 
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of  hosts!
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of  Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living ùGod.
Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest  for herself, where she layeth her young, thine altars, O  Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be  constantly praising thee. Selah.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, -- they, in  whose heart are the highways.
Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a  well-spring; yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.
They go from strength to strength: \each one\ will appear  before God in Zion.
Jehovah, God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of  Jacob. Selah.
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine  anointed.
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had  rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God, than  dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For Jehovah Elohim is a sun and shield: Jehovah will give  grace and glory; no good thing will he withhold from them that  walk uprightly.
Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man that confideth in  thee!
