{A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent?  who shall dwell in the hill of thy holiness?
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and  speaketh the truth from his heart.
\He that\ slandereth not with his tongue, doeth not evil to  his companion, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;
In whose eyes the depraved person is contemned, and who  honoureth them that fear Jehovah; who, if he have sworn to his  own hurt, changeth it not;
\He that\ putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh  reward against the innocent. He that doeth these \things\ shall  never be moved.
