{\A Psalm\ of David.} Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all  that is within me, \bless\ his holy name!
Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy  diseases;
Who redeemeth thy life from the pit, who crowneth thee  with loving-kindness and tender mercies;
Who satisfieth thine old age with good \things\; thy youth  is renewed like the eagle`s.
Jehovah executeth righteousness and justice for all that  are oppressed.
He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the  children of Israel.
Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and  abundant in loving-kindness.
He will not always chide, neither will he keep \his anger\  for ever.
He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, nor  rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is  his loving-kindness toward them that fear him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he  removed our transgressions from us.
As a father pitieth \his\ children, so Jehovah pitieth  them that fear him.
For himself knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are  dust.
As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the  field, so he flourisheth:
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone, and the  place thereof knoweth it no more.
But the loving-kindness of Jehovah is from everlasting  and to everlasting, upon them that fear him, and his  righteousness unto children`s children,
To such as keep his covenant and to those that remember  his precepts to do them.
Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens, and  his kingdom ruleth over all.
Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, mighty in strength, that  execute his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his that  do his will.
Bless Jehovah, all his works, in all places of his  dominion. Bless Jehovah, O my soul!
