When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a  people of strange language,
Judah was his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
The sea saw it and fled, the Jordan turned back;
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
What ailed thee, thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou  Jordan, that thou turnedst back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? ye hills, like  lambs?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the  presence of the +God of Jacob,
Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a  fountain of waters.
