{A Psalm of David.} Jehovah, hear my prayer; give ear to  my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, in thy  righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy  sight no man living shall be justified.
For the enemy persecuteth my soul: he hath crushed my life  down to the earth; he hath made me to dwell in dark places, as  those that have been long dead.
And my spirit is overwhelmed within me; my heart within me  is desolate.
I remember the days of old: I meditate on all thy doing; I  muse on the work of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul, as a parched  land, \thirsteth\ after thee. Selah.
Answer me speedily, O Jehovah; my spirit faileth: hide not  thy face from me, or I shall be like unto them that go down  into the pit.
Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning, for  in thee do I confide; make me to know the way wherein I should  walk, for unto thee do I lift up my soul.
Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies: unto thee do I  flee for refuge.
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: let thy  good Spirit lead me in a plain country.
Revive me, O Jehovah, for thy name`s sake; in thy  righteousness bring my soul out of trouble;
And in thy loving-kindness cut off mine enemies, and  destroy all them that oppress my soul: for I am thy servant.
