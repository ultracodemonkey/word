Hallelujah! Praise the name of Jehovah; praise, ye  servants of Jehovah,
Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of  the house of our God.
Praise ye Jah; for Jehovah is good: sing psalms unto his  name; for it is pleasant.
For Jah hath chosen Jacob unto himself, Israel for his own  possession.
For *I* know that Jehovah is great, and our Lord is above  all gods.
Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, he hath done in the heavens  and on the earth, in the seas and all deeps;
Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the  earth; who maketh lightnings for the rain; who bringeth the  wind out of his treasuries:
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast;
Who sent signs and miracles into the midst of thee, O  Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants;
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings,
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and  all the kingdoms of Canaan;
And gave their land for an inheritance, an inheritance  unto Israel his people.
Thy name, O Jehovah, is for ever; thy memorial, O  Jehovah, from generation to generation.
For Jehovah will judge his people, and will repent in  favour of his servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of  men`s hands:
They have a mouth, and they speak not; eyes have they,  and they see not;
They have ears, and they hear not; neither is there any  breath in their mouth.
They that make them are like unto them, -- every one that  confideth in them.
House of Israel, bless ye Jehovah; house of Aaron, bless  ye Jehovah;
House of Levi, bless ye Jehovah; ye that fear Jehovah,  bless Jehovah.
Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who dwelleth at  Jerusalem! Hallelujah!
