Hallelujah! Praise ùGod in his sanctuary; praise him in  the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his mighty acts; praise him according to the  abundance of his greatness.
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; praise him with  lute and harp;
Praise him with the tambour and dance; praise him with  stringed instruments and the pipe;
Praise him with loud cymbals; praise him with high  sounding cymbals.
Let everything that hath breath praise Jah. Hallelujah!
