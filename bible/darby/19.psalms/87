{Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm. A Song.} His foundation is  in the mountains of holiness.
Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the  habitations of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that  know me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: this \man\  was born there.
And of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was  born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish her.
Jehovah will count, when he inscribeth the peoples, This  \man\ was born there. Selah.
As well the singers as the dancers \shall say\, All my  springs are in thee.
