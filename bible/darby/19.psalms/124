{A Song of degrees. Of David.} If it had not been Jehovah  who was for us -- oh let Israel say --
If it had not been Jehovah who was for us, when men rose  up against us,
Then they had swallowed us up alive, when their anger was  kindled against us;
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, a torrent had gone  over our soul;
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
Blessed be Jehovah, who gave us not up a prey to their  teeth!
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the  fowlers: the snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the maker of heavens  and earth.
