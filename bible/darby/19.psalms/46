{To the chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. On Alamoth. A  song.} 
God is our refuge and strength, a help in distresses,  very readily found.
Therefore will we not fear though the earth be removed, and  though the mountains be carried into the heart of the seas;
Though the waters thereof roar \and\ foam, though the  mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of  God, the sanctuary of the habitations of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God  shall help her at the dawn of the morning.
The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his  voice, the earth melted.
Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high  fortress. Selah.
Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what desolations he hath  made in the earth:
He hath made wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he  breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth  the chariots in the fire.
Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among  the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high  fortress. Selah.
