{A Song, a Psalm of David.} 
My heart is fixed, O God: I  will sing, yea, I will sing psalms, even \with\ my glory.
Awake, lute and harp: I will wake the dawn.
I will give thee thanks among the peoples, O Jehovah; of  thee will I sing psalms among the nations:
For thy loving-kindness is great above the heavens, and  thy truth is unto the clouds.
Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and thy glory  above all the earth.
That thy beloved ones may be delivered: save with thy  right hand, and answer me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will  divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the  strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;
Moab is my wash-pot; upon Edom will I cast my sandal; over  Philistia will I shout aloud.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me  unto Edom?
\Wilt\ not \thou\, O God, who didst cast us off? and  didst not go forth, O God, with our armies?
Give us help from trouble; for vain is man`s deliverance.
Through God we shall do valiantly; and he it is that will  tread down our adversaries.
