{\A Psalm\ of David.} Unto thee, Jehovah, do I call; my  rock, be not silent unto me, lest, \if\ thou keep silence  toward me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,  when I lift up my hands toward the oracle of thy holiness.
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of  iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbours, and mischief is  in their heart.
Give them according to their doing, and according to the  wickedness of their deeds; give them after the work of their  hands, render to them their desert.
For they regard not the deeds of Jehovah, nor the work of  his hands: he will destroy them, and not build them up.
Blessed be Jehovah, for he hath heard the voice of my  supplications.
Jehovah is my strength and my shield; my heart confided in  him, and I was helped: therefore my heart exulteth, and with my  song will I praise him.
Jehovah is their strength; and he is the stronghold of  salvation to his anointed one.
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; and feed  them, and lift them up for ever.
