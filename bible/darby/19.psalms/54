{To the chief Musician. On stringed instruments: an  instruction. Of David; when the Ziphites came, and said to  Saul, Is not David hiding himself with us?} 
O God, by thy name  save me, and by thy strength do me justice.
O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and the violent seek  after my life: they have not set God before them. Selah.
Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is among them that  uphold my soul.
He will requite evil to mine enemies: in thy truth cut them  off.
I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will praise thy name,  O Jehovah, because it is good.
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye  hath seen \its desire\ upon mine enemies.
