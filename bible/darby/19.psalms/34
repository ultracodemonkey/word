{\A Psalm\ of David; when he changed his behaviour before  Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.} 
I will bless  Jehovah at all times; his praise shall continually be in my  mouth.
My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah: the meek shall  hear, and rejoice.
Magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt his name  together.
I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, and delivered me from  all my fears.
They looked unto him, and were enlightened, and their faces  were not confounded.
This afflicted one called, and Jehovah heard \him\, and  saved him out of all his troubles.
The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear  him, and delivereth them.
Taste and see that Jehovah is good: blessed is the man that  trusteth in him!
Fear Jehovah, ye his saints; for there is no want to them  that fear him.
The young lions are in need and suffer hunger; but they  that seek Jehovah shall not want any good.
Come, ye sons, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear  of Jehovah.
What man is he that desireth life, \and\ loveth days, that  he may see good?
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking  guile;
Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, and his ears  are toward their cry;
The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, to cut  off the remembrance of them from the earth:
\The righteous\ cry, and Jehovah heareth, and delivereth  them out of all their troubles.
Jehovah is nigh to those that are of a broken heart, and  saveth them that are of a contrite spirit.
Many are the adversities of the righteous, but Jehovah  delivereth him out of them all:
He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.
Evil shall destroy the wicked; and they that hate the  righteous shall bear their guilt.
Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; and none of  them that trust in him shall bear guilt.
