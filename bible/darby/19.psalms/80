{To the chief Musician. On Shoshannim-Eduth. Of Asaph. A  Psalm.} 
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest  Joseph like a flock; thou that sittest \between\ the cherubim,  shine forth.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy  strength, and come to our deliverance.
O God, restore us; and cause thy face to shine, and we  shall be saved.
Jehovah, God of hosts, how long will thine anger smoke  against the prayer of thy people?
Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them  tears to drink in large measure:
Thou hast made us a strife unto our neighbours, and our  enemies mock among themselves.
Restore us, O God of hosts; and cause thy face to shine,  and we shall be saved.
Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt; thou didst cast out  the nations, and plant it:
Thou preparedst space before it, and it took deep root, and  filled the land;
The mountains were covered with its shadow, and the  branches thereof were \like\ cedars of ùGod;
It sent out its boughs unto the sea, and its shoots unto  the river.
Why hast thou broken down its fences, so that all who pass  by the way do pluck it?
The boar out of the forest doth waste it, and the beast of  the field doth feed off it.
O God of hosts, return, we beseech thee; look down from  the heavens, and behold, and visit this vine;
Even the stock which thy right hand hath planted, and the  young plant thou madest strong for thyself.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the  rebuke of thy countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the  son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself.
So will we not go back from thee. Revive us, and we will  call upon thy name.
Restore us, O Jehovah, God of hosts; cause thy face to  shine, and we shall be saved.
