Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly  nation; deliver me from the deceitful and unrighteous man.
For thou art the God of my strength: why hast thou cast me  off? why go I about mourning because of the oppression of the  enemy?
Send out thy light and thy truth: *they* shall lead me,  *they* shall bring me to thy holy mount, and unto thy  habitations.
Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto the ùGod of the  gladness of my joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O  God, my God.
Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou  disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise him,  \who is\ the health of my countenance, and my God.
