{To the chief Musician. `Destroy not.` Of David. Michtam;  when he fled from Saul in the cave.} 
Be gracious unto me, O  God, be gracious unto me; for my soul taketh refuge in thee:  yea, in the shadow of thy wings do I take refuge, until the  calamities be overpast.
I will call unto God, the Most High; unto ùGod that  performeth \all\ for me.
He will send from the heavens and save me; he hath covered  with reproach him that would swallow me up. Selah. God hath  sent forth his loving-kindness and his truth.
My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down \among\ them  that breathe out flames, the sons of men, whose teeth are  spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let thy glory be above  all the earth!
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul was bowed  down: they have digged a pit before me; they are fallen into  the midst thereof. Selah.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing,  yea, I will sing psalms.
Awake, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I will wake the  dawn.
I will give thee thanks among the peoples, O Lord; of thee  will I sing psalms among the nations:
For thy loving-kindness is great unto the heavens, and thy  truth unto the clouds.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let thy glory be  above all the earth!
