And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them a  staff, a staff for each father`s house, of all their princes  according to the houses of their fathers, twelve staves: thou  shalt write each one`s name upon his staff.
And Aaron`s name shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi;  for one staff shall be for \each\ head of their fathers`  houses.
And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before  the testimony, where I meet with you.
And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall  choose, his staff shall bud forth; and I will make to cease  from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel, that  they murmur against you.
And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their  princes gave him a staff, one staff for each prince according  to their fathers` houses, twelve staves, and the staff of Aaron  was among their staves.
And Moses laid the staves before Jehovah in the tent of the  testimony.
And it came to pass, when on the morrow Moses went into the  tent of the testimony, behold, the staff of Aaron for the house  of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed  blossoms, and ripened almonds.
And Moses brought out all the staves from before Jehovah to  all the children of Israel, and they looked and took each one  his staff.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Bring Aaron`s staff again  before the testimony, to be kept as a token for the sons of  rebellion, that thou mayest put an end to their murmurings  before me, that they may not die.
And Moses did so: as Jehovah had commanded him, so did he.
And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Lo, we  expire, we perish, we all perish.
Every one that comes at all near to the tabernacle of  Jehovah shall die: shall we then expire altogether?
