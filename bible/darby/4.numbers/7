And it came to pass on the day that Moses had completed the  setting up of the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and hallowed  it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all its  utensils, and had anointed them, and hallowed them,
that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers`  houses, the princes of the tribes, they that were over them  that had been numbered, offered;
and they brought their offering before Jehovah, six covered  waggons, and twelve oxen; a waggon for two princes, and an ox  for each; and they presented them before the tabernacle.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Take it of them, and they shall be for the performance of  the service of the tent of meeting, and thou shalt give them  unto the Levites, to each according to his service.
And Moses took the waggons and the oxen, and gave them to  the Levites.
Two waggons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon,  according to their service;
and four waggons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of  Merari, according to their service, -- under the hand of  Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
