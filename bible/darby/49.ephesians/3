For this reason *I* Paul, prisoner of the Christ Jesus for  you nations,
(if indeed ye have heard of the administration of the grace  of God which has been given to me towards you,
that by revelation the mystery has been made known to me,  (according as I have written before briefly,
by which, in reading it, ye can understand my intelligence  in the mystery of the Christ,)
which in other generations has not been made known to the  sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles  and prophets in \the power of the\ Spirit,
that \they who are of\ the nations should be joint heirs,  and a joint body, and joint partakers of \his\ promise in  Christ Jesus by the glad tidings;
of which I am become minister according to the gift of the  grace of God given to me, according to the working of his  power.
To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace  been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of  the unsearchable riches of the Christ,
and to enlighten all \with the knowledge of\ what is the  administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in  God, who has created all things,
in order that now to the principalities and authorities in  the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the  all-various wisdom of God,
according to \the\ purpose of the ages, which he purposed  in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the  faith of him.
Wherefore I beseech \you\ not to faint through my  tribulations for you, which is your glory.
For this reason I bow my knees to the Father \of our Lord  Jesus Christ\,
of whom every family in \the\ heavens and on earth is  named,
in order that he may give you according to the riches of  his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the  inner man;
that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts,  being rooted and founded in love,
in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all  the saints what \is\ the breadth and length and depth and  height;
and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses  knowledge; that ye may be filled \even\ to all the fulness of  God.
But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all  which we ask or think, according to the power which works in  us,
to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all  generations of the age of ages. Amen).
