Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children,
and walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered  himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a  sweet-smelling savour.
But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust, let  it not be even named among you, as it becomes saints;
and filthiness and foolish talking, or jesting, which are  not convenient; but rather thanksgiving.
For this ye are \well\ informed of, knowing that no  fornicator, or unclean person, or person of unbridled lust, who  is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ  and God.
Let no one deceive you with vain words, for on account of  these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of  disobedience.
Be not ye therefore fellow-partakers with them;
for ye were once darkness, but now light in \the\ Lord; walk  as children of light,
(for the fruit of the light \is\ in all goodness and  righteousness and truth,)
proving what is agreeable to the Lord;
and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of  darkness, but rather also reprove \them\,
for the things that are done by them in secret it is  shameful even to say.
But all things having their true character exposed by the  light are made manifest; for that which makes everything  manifest is light.
Wherefore he says, Wake up, \thou\ that sleepest, and arise  up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.
See therefore how ye walk carefully, not as unwise but as  wise,
redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
For this reason be not foolish, but understanding what \is\  the will of the Lord.
And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be  filled with the Spirit,
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual  songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord;
giving thanks at all times for all things to him \who is\  God and \the\ Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
submitting yourselves to one another in \the\ fear of  Christ.
Wives, \submit yourselves\ to your own husbands, as to the  Lord,
for a husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ \is\  head of the assembly. *He* \is\ Saviour of the body.
But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so  also wives to their own husbands in everything.
Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also  loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it,
in order that he might sanctify it, purifying \it\ by the  washing of water by \the\ word,
that *he* might present the assembly to himself glorious,  having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it  might be holy and blameless.
So ought men also to love their own wives as their own  bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself.
For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and  cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly:
for we are members of his body; \we are of his flesh, and  of his bones.\
Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother,  and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one  flesh.
This mystery is great, but *I* speak as to Christ, and as  to the assembly.
But *ye* also, every one of you, let each so love his own  wife as himself; but as to the wife \I speak\ that she may fear  the husband.
