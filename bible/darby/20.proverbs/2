My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my  commandments with thee,
so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom \and\ thou apply  thy heart to understanding;
yea, if thou criest after discernment \and\ liftest up thy  voice to understanding;
if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for  hidden treasures:
then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the  knowledge of God.
For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth \come\ knowledge  and understanding.
He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; \he\ is a shield  to them that walk in integrity;
guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of  his godly ones.
Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and  equity: every good path.
When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is  pleasant unto thy soul,
discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve  thee:
To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that  speaketh froward things;
\from those\ who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in  the ways of darkness;
who rejoice to do evil, \and\ delight in the frowardness of  evil;
whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their  course:
To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger  who flattereth with her words;
who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the  covenant of her God;
-- for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto  the dead;
none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain  to the paths of life:
-- that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, and keep  the paths of the righteous.
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect  shall remain in it;
but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the  unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.
