I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge  living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom,
proclaim the word; be urgent in season \and\ out of season,  convict, rebuke, encourage, with all longsuffering and  doctrine.
For the time shall be when they will not bear sound  teaching; but according to their own lusts will heap up to  themselves teachers, having an itching ear;
and they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will  have turned aside to fables.
But *thou*, be sober in all things, bear evils, do \the\  work of an evangelist, fill up the full measure of thy  ministry.
For *I* am already being poured out, and the time of my  release is come.
I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I  have kept the faith.
Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me,  which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that  day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his  appearing.
Use diligence to come to me quickly;
for Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age,  and is gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to  Dalmatia.
Luke alone is with me. Take Mark, and bring \him\ with  thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry.
But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
The cloak which I left behind \me\ in Troas at Carpus`s,  bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the  parchments.
Alexander the smith did many evil things against me. The  Lord will render to him according to his works.
Against whom be *thou* also on thy guard, for he has  greatly withstood our words.
At my first defence no man stood with me, but all deserted  me. May it not be imputed to them.
But the Lord stood with \me\, and gave me power, that  through me the proclamation might be fully made, and all \those  of\ the nations should hear; and I was delivered out of the  lion`s mouth.
The Lord shall deliver me from every wicked work, and shall  preserve \me\ for his heavenly kingdom; to whom \be\ glory for  the ages of ages. Amen.
Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left behind in  Miletus sick.
Use diligence to come before winter. Eubulus salutes thee,  and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and the brethren all.
The Lord Jesus Christ \be\ with your spirit. Grace \be\  with you.
