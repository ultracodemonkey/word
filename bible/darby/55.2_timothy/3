But this know, that in \the\ last days difficult times shall  be there;
for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,  arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful,  profane,
without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of  unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good,
traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure  rather than lovers of God;
having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from  these turn away.
For of these are they who are getting into houses, and  leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various  lusts,
always learning, and never able to come to \the\ knowledge  of \the\ truth.
Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood  Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in  mind, found worthless as regards the faith.
But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be  completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.
But *thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted with my  teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love,  endurance,
persecutions, sufferings: what \sufferings\ happened to me  in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured;  and the Lord delivered me out of all.
And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus  will be persecuted.
But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in  evil, leading and being led astray.
But *thou*, abide in those things which thou hast learned,  and \of which\ thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom  thou hast learned \them\;
and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters,  which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith  which \is\ in Christ Jesus.
Every scripture \is\ divinely inspired, and profitable for  teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in  righteousness;
that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every  good work.
