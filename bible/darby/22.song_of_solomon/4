Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine  eyes are doves behind thy veil; Thy hair is as a flock of  goats, On the slopes of mount Gilead.
Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, Which go up from  the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren  among them.
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy speech is  comely; As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy  veil.
Thy neck is like the tower of David, Built for an armoury: A  thousand bucklers hang thereon, All shields of mighty men.
Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle,  Which feed among the lilies.
Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee away, I will get me  to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.
Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.
\Come\ with me, from Lebanon, \my\ spouse, With me from  Lebanon, -- Come, look from the top of Amanah, From the top of  Senir and Hermon, From the lions` dens, From the mountains of  the leopards.
Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, \my\ spouse; Thou  hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain  of thy neck.
How fair is thy love, my sister, \my\ spouse! How much  better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine  ointments than all spices!
Thy lips, \my\ spouse, drop \as\ the honeycomb; Honey and  milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is  like the smell of Lebanon.
A garden enclosed is my sister, \my\ spouse; A spring shut  up, a fountain sealed.
Thy shoots are a paradise of pomegranates, with precious  fruits; Henna with spikenard plants;
Spikenard and saffron; Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees  of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
A fountain in the gardens, A well of living waters, Which  stream from Lebanon.
Awake, north wind, and come, \thou\ south; Blow upon my  garden, \that\ the spices thereof may flow forth. Let my  beloved come into his garden, And eat its precious fruits.
