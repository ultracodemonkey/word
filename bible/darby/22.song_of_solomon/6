Whither is thy beloved gone, Thou fairest among women?  Whither is thy beloved turned aside? And we will seek him with  thee.
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of  spices, To feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.
I am my beloved`s, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth \his  flock\ among the lilies.
Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem,  Terrible as troops with banners:
Turn away thine eyes from me, For they overcome me. Thy hair  is as a flock of goats On the slopes of Gilead.
Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep Which go up from the  washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren among  them.
As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil.
There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And  virgins without number:
My dove, mine undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of  her mother, She is the choice one of her that bore her. The  daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; The queens and  the concubines, and they praised her.
Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, Fair as the  moon, clear as the sun, Terrible as troops with banners?
I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the verdure of  the valley, To see whether the vine budded, Whether the  pomegranates blossomed.
Before I was aware, My soul set me upon the chariots of my  willing people.
Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may  look upon thee. -- What would ye look upon in the Shulamite? --  As it were the dance of two camps.
