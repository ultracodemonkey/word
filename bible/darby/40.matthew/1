Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of  Abraham.
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat  Juda and his brethren;
and Juda begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat  Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram,
and Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and  Naasson begat Salmon,
and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of  Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse,
and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon, of  her \that had been the wife\ of Urias;
and Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia, and Abia  begat Asa,
and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram, and Joram  begat Ozias,
and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Achaz, and Achaz  begat Ezekias,
and Ezekias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon, and  Amon begat Josias,
and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, at the time of  the carrying away of Babylon.
And after the carrying away of Babylon, Jechonias begat  Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,
and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and  Eliakim begat Azor,
and Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim  begat Eliud,
and Eliud begat Eliazar, and Eliazar begat Matthan, and  Matthan begat Jacob,
and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was  born Jesus, who is called Christ.
All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David  \were\ fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying  away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying  away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary,  that is, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came  together, she was found to be with child of \the\ Holy Spirit.
But Joseph, her husband, being \a\ righteous \man\, and  unwilling to expose her publicly, purposed to have put her away  secretly;
but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of  \the\ Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of  David, fear not to take to \thee\ Mary, thy wife, for that  which is begotten in her is of \the\ Holy Spirit.
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his  name Jesus, for *he* shall save his people from their sins.
Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled  which was spoken by \the\ Lord, through the prophet, saying,
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring  forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is,  being interpreted, `God with us.`
But Joseph, having awoke up from his sleep, did as the  angel of \the\ Lord had enjoined him, and took to \him\ his  wife,
and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn  son: and he called his name Jesus.
