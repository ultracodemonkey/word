Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to  Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with \me\;
and I went up according to revelation, and I laid before  them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but  privately to those conspicuous \among them\, lest in any way I  run or had run in vain;
(but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek,  compelled to be circumcised;)
and \it was\ on account of the false brethren brought in  surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our  liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us  into bondage;
to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that  the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you.
But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat --  whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does  not accept man`s person; for to me those who were conspicuous  communicated nothing;
but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the  uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of  the circumcision,
(for he that wrought in Peter for \the\ apostleship of the  circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,)
and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and  John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and  Barnabas \the\ right hands of fellowship, that *we* \should go\  to the nations, and *they* to the circumcision;
only that we should remember the poor, which same thing  also I was diligent to do.
But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to \the\  face, because he was to be condemned:
for before that certain came from James, he ate with \those  of\ the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated  himself, fearing those of \the\ circumcision;
and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling  part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by  their dissimulation.
But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly,  according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter  before all, If *thou*, being a Jew, livest as the nations and  not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize?
We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of \the\ nations,
but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of  works of law \nor\ but by the faith of Jesus Christ, *we* also  have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on  the principle of \the\ faith of Christ; and not of works of  law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be  justified.
Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have  been found sinners, then \is\ Christ minister of sin? Far be  the thought.
For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again,  I constitute myself a transgressor.
For *I*, through law, have died to law, that I may live to  God.
I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but  Christ lives in me; but \in\ that I now live in flesh, I live  by faith, the \faith\ of the Son of God, who has loved me and  given himself for me.
I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness  \is\ by law, then Christ has died for nothing.
