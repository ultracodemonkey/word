Paul, apostle, not from men nor through man, but through  Jesus Christ, and God \the\ Father who raised him from among  \the\ dead,
and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia.
Grace to you, and peace, from God \the\ Father, and our Lord  Jesus Christ,
who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us  out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God  and Father;
to whom \be\ glory to the ages of ages. Amen.
I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called  you in Christ`s grace, to a different gospel,
which is not another \one\; but there are some that trouble  you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.
But if even *we* or an angel out of heaven announce as glad  tidings to you \anything\ besides what we have announced as  glad tidings to you, let him be accursed.
As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one  announce to you as glad tidings \anything\ besides what ye have  received, let him be accursed.
For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to  please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ`s  bondman.
But I let you know, brethren, \as to\ the glad tidings  which were announced by me, that they are not according to man.
For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I  taught \them\, but by revelation of Jesus Christ.
For ye have heard \what was\ my conversation formerly in  Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and  ravaged it;
and advanced in Judaism beyond many \my\ contemporaries in  my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my  fathers.
But when God, who set me apart \even\ from my mother`s  womb, and called \me\ by his grace,
was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce  him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not  counsel with flesh and blood,
nor went I up to Jerusalem to those \who were\ apostles  before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to  Damascus.
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make  acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days;
but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother  of the Lord.
Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.
Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea  which \are\ in Christ;
only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly  now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he  ravaged:
and they glorified God in me.
