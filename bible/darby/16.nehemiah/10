And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the  doorkeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had  separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law  of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters, every one  having knowledge \and\ having understanding,
joined with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into  a curse and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which had  been given by Moses the servant of God, and to keep and do all  the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, and his ordinances and  his statutes;
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of  the land, nor take their daughters for our sons:
and that if the peoples of the land brought wares or any  grain on the sabbath day to sell, we would not take it of them  on the sabbath, or on \any\ holy day; and that we would leave  \the land uncultivated\ the seventh year, and the exaction of  every debt.
And we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly  with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of  our God,
for the bread to be set in rows, and for the continual  oblation, and for the continual burnt-offering, \for that\ of  the sabbaths \and\ of the new moons, for the set feasts and for  the holy \things\, and for the sin-offerings to make an  atonement for Israel, and \for\ all the work of the house of  our God.
And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and  the people, for the wood-offering, to bring \it\ into the house  of our God, according to our fathers` houses, at times  appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of Jehovah our  God, as it is written in the law;
and to bring the first-fruits of our land, and the  first-fruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year to the  house of Jehovah,
and the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, as it is  written in the law; and to bring the firstlings of our herds  and of our flocks to the house of our God, to the priests that  minister in the house of our God;
and that we should bring the first-fruits of our coarse  meal and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of  trees, new wine and oil, to the priests, into the chambers of  the house of our God, and the tithes of our ground to the  Levites, that they, the Levites, should take the tithes in all  the cities of our tillage.
And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,  when the Levites take tithes; and the Levites shall bring up  the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, into the  chambers of the treasure-house.
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall  bring the heave-offering of the corn, of the new wine and the  oil, into the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary,  and the priests that minister, and the doorkeepers and the  singers. And we will not forsake the house of our God.
