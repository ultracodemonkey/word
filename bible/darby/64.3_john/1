The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
Beloved, I desire that in all things thou shouldest prosper  and be in health, even as thy soul prospers.
For I rejoiced exceedingly when \the\ brethren came and bore  testimony to thy \holding fast the\ truth, even as *thou*  walkest in truth.
I have no greater joy than these things that I hear of my  children walking in the truth.
Beloved, thou doest faithfully \in\ whatever thou mayest  have wrought towards the brethren and that strangers,
(who have witnessed of thy love before \the\ assembly,) in  setting forward whom on their journey worthily of God, thou  wilt do well;
for for the name have they gone forth, taking nothing of  those of the nations.
*We* therefore ought to receive such, that we may be  fellow-workers with the truth.
I wrote something to the assembly; but Diotrephes, who loves  to have the first place among them, receives us not.
For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his  works which he does, babbling against us with wicked words; and  not content with these, neither does he himself receive the  brethren; and those who would he prevents, and casts \them\ out  of the assembly.
Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He  that does good is of God. He that does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has witness borne to him by all, and by the truth  itself; and *we* also bear witness, and thou knowest that our  witness is true.
I had many things to write to thee, but I will not with ink  and pen write to thee;
but I hope soon to see thee, and we will speak mouth to  mouth. Peace \be\ to thee. The friends greet thee. Greet the  friends by name.
