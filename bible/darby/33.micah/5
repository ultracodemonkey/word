And I will cut off sorceries out of thy hand; and thou  shalt have no soothsayers.
Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy statues out  of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more bow down to the  work of thy hands.
And I will pluck up thine Asherahs out of the midst of  thee, and I will destroy thy cities.
And I will execute vengeance in anger and in fury upon the  nations, such as they have not heard of.
