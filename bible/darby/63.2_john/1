The elder to \the\ elect lady and her children, whom *I*  love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the  truth,
for the truth`s sake which abides in us and shall be with us  to eternity.
Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God \the\ Father,  and from \the\ Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in  truth and love.
I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking  in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.
And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new  commandment, but that which we have had from \the\ beginning,  that we should love one another.
And this is love, that we should walk according to his  commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye have  heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do  not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh -- this is the  deceiver and the antichrist.
See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have  wrought, but may receive full wages.
Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the  Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, *he* has  both the Father and the Son.
If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not  receive him into \the\ house, and greet him not;
for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works.
Having many things to write to you, I would not with paper  and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth,  that our joy may be full.
The children of thine elect sister greet thee.
