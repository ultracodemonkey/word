I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications,  prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men;
for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a  quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity;
for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God,
who desires that all men should be saved and come to \the\  knowledge of \the\ truth.
For God is one, and \the\ mediator of God and men one, \the\  man Christ Jesus,
who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony \to be  rendered\ in its own times;
to which *I* have been appointed a herald and apostle, (I  speak \the\ truth, I do not lie,) a teacher of \the\ nations in  faith and truth.
I will therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting  up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning.
In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and  dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion, not with  plaited \hair\ and gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,
but, what becomes women making profession of the fear of  God, by good works.
Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection;
but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise  authority over man, but to be in quietness;
for Adam was formed first, then Eve:
and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been  deceived, was in transgression.
But she shall be preserved in childbearing, if they  continue in faith and love and holiness with discretion.
