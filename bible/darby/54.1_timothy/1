Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ, according to \the\ command of  God our Saviour, and of Christ Jesus our hope,
to Timotheus, \my\ true child in faith: grace, mercy, peace,  from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Even as I begged thee to remain in Ephesus, \when I was\  going to Macedonia, that thou mightest enjoin some not to teach  other doctrines,
nor to turn their minds to fables and interminable  genealogies, which bring questionings rather than \further\  God`s dispensation, which \is\ in faith.
But the end of what is enjoined is love out of a pure heart  and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;
which \things\ some having missed, have turned aside to vain  discourse,
desiring to be law-teachers, not understanding either what  they say or concerning what they \so\ strenuously affirm.
Now we know that the law \is\ good if any one uses it  lawfully,
knowing this, that law has not its application to a  righteous person, but to \the\ lawless and insubordinate, to  \the\ impious and sinful, to \the\ unholy and profane, to  smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers; to murderers,
fornicators, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, perjurers; and  if any other thing is opposed to sound teaching,
according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed  God, with which *I* have been entrusted.
\And\ I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me  power, that he has counted me faithful, appointing to ministry  him
who before was a blasphemer and persecutor, and an insolent  overbearing \man\: but mercy was shewn me because I did it  ignorantly, in unbelief.
But the grace of our Lord surpassingly over-abounded with  faith and love, which \is\ in Christ Jesus.
Faithful \is\ the word, and worthy of all acceptation, that  Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom *I*  am \the\ first.
But for this reason mercy was shewn me, that in me, \the\  first, Jesus Christ might display the whole long-suffering, for  a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal.
Now to the King of the ages, \the\ incorruptible,  invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages of ages.  Amen.
This charge, \my\ child Timotheus, I commit to thee,  according to the prophecies as to thee preceding, in order that  thou mightest war by them the good warfare,
maintaining faith and a good conscience; which \last\ some,  having put away, have made shipwreck as to faith;
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered  to Satan, that they may be taught by discipline not to  blaspheme.
