The word \is\ faithful: if any one aspires to exercise  oversight, he desires a good work.
The overseer then must be irreproachable, husband of one  wife, sober, discreet, decorous, hospitable, apt to teach;
not given to excesses from wine, not a striker, but mild,  not addicted to contention, not fond of money,
conducting his own house well, having \his\ children in  subjection with all gravity;
(but if one does not know how to conduct his own house, how  shall he take care of the assembly of God?)
not a novice, that he may not, being inflated, fall into  \the\ fault of the devil.
But it is necessary that he should have also a good  testimony from those without, that he may fall not into  reproach and \the\ snare of the devil.
Ministers, in like manner, grave, not double-tongued, not  given to much wine, not seeking gain by base means,
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
And let these be first proved, then let them minister,  being without charge \against them\.
\The\ women in like manner grave, not slanderers, sober,  faithful in all things.
Let \the\ ministers be husbands of one wife, conducting  \their\ children and their own houses well:
for those who shall have ministered well obtain for  themselves a good degree, and much boldness in faith which \is\  in Christ Jesus.
These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee more  quickly;
but if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one  ought to conduct oneself in God`s house, which is \the\  assembly of \the\ living God, \the\ pillar and base of the  truth.
And confessedly the mystery of piety is great. God has been  manifested in flesh, has been justified in \the\ Spirit, has  appeared to angels, has been preached among \the\ nations, has  been believed on in \the\ world, has been received up in glory.
