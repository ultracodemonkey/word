After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in  heaven, and the first voice which I heard as of a trumpet  speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will shew thee  the things which must take place after these things.
Immediately I became in \the\ Spirit; and behold, a throne  stood in the heaven, and upon the throne one sitting,
and he \that was\ sitting like in appearance to a stone \of\  jasper and a sardius, and a rainbow round the throne like in  appearance to an emerald.
And round the throne twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones  twenty-four elders sitting, clothed with white garments; and on  their heads golden crowns.
And out of the throne go forth lightnings, and voices, and  thunders; and seven lamps of fire, burning before the throne,  which are the seven Spirits of God;
and before the throne, as a glass sea, like crystal. And in  the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living  creatures, full of eyes, before and behind;
and the first living creature like a lion, and the second  living creature like a calf, and the third living creature  having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature  like a flying eagle.
And the four living creatures, each one of them having  respectively six wings; round and within they are full of eyes;  and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord  God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour  and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to  the ages of ages,
the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon  the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of  ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Thou art worthy, O our Lord and \our\ God, to receive glory  and honour and power; for *thou* hast created all things, and  for thy will they were, and they have been created.
