And I saw an angel descending from the heaven, having the  key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.
And he laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent who is  \the\ devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
and cast him into the abyss, and shut \it\ and sealed \it\  over him, that he should not any more deceive the nations until  the thousand years were completed; after these things he must  be loosed for a little time.
And I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was  given to them; and the souls of those beheaded on account of  the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and  those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image,  and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand; and  they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years:
the rest of the dead did not live till the thousand years  had been completed. This \is\ the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection:  over these the second death has no power; but they shall be  priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a  thousand years.
And when the thousand years have been completed, Satan  shall be loosed from his prison,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which \are\ in the  four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them  together to the war, whose number \is\ as the sand of the sea.
And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and  surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city: and  fire came down \from God\ out of the heaven and devoured them.
And the devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of  fire and brimstone, where \are\ both the beast and the false  prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for the ages  of ages.
And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it,  from whose face the earth and the heaven fled, and place was  not found for them.
And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the  throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened,  which is \that\ of life. And the dead were judged out of the  things written in the books according to their works.
And the sea gave up the dead which \were\ in it, and death  and hades gave up the dead which \were\ in them; and they were  judged each according to their works:
and death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. This  is the second death, \even\ the lake of fire.
And if any one was not found written in the book of life,  he was cast into the lake of fire.
