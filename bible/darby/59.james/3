Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall  receive greater judgment.
For we all often offend. If any one offend not in word, *he*  \is\ a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body too.
Behold, we put the bits in the mouths of the horses, that  they may obey us, and we turn round their whole bodies.
Behold also the ships, which are so great, and driven by  violent winds, are turned about by a very small rudder,  wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will.
Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great  things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles!
and the tongue \is\ fire, the world of unrighteousness; the  tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body,  and which sets fire to the course of nature, and is set on fire  of hell.
For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of  creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed  by the human species;
but the tongue can no one among men tame; \it is\ an  unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison.
Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse  we men made after \the\ likeness of God.
Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It  is not right, my brethren, that these things should be thus.
Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth  sweet and bitter?
Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs?  Neither \can\ salt \water\ make sweet water.
Who \is\ wise and understanding among you; let him shew out  of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom;
but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts,  do not boast and lie against the truth.
This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but  earthly, natural, devilish.
For where emulation and strife \are\, there \is\ disorder  and every evil thing.
But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful,  gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning,  unfeigned.
But \the\ fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them  that make peace.
