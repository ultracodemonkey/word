Whence \come\ wars and whence fightings among you? \Is it\  not thence, -- from your pleasures, which war in your members?
Ye lust and have not: ye kill and are full of envy, and  cannot obtain; ye fight and war; ye have not because ye ask  not.
Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may  consume \it\ in your pleasures.
Adulteresses, know ye not that friendship with the world is  enmity with God? Whoever therefore is minded to be \the\ friend  of the world is constituted enemy of God.
Think ye that the scripture speaks in vain? Does the Spirit  which has taken his abode in us desire enviously?
But he gives more grace. Wherefore he says, God sets himself  against \the\ proud, but gives grace to \the\ lowly.
Subject yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and  he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse  \your\ hands, sinners, and purify \your\ hearts, ye  double-minded.
Be wretched, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be  turned to mourning, and \your\ joy to heaviness.
Humble yourselves before \the\ Lord, and he shall exalt  you.
Speak not against one another, brethren. He that speaks  against \his\ brother, or judges his brother, speaks against  \the\ law and judges \the\ law. But if thou judgest \the\ law,  thou art not doer of \the\ law, but judge.
One is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to  destroy: but who art *thou* who judgest thy neighbour?
Go to now, ye who say, To-day or to-morrow will we go into  such a city and spend a year there, and traffic and make gain,
ye who do not know what will be on the morrow, (\for\ what  \is\ your life? It is even a vapour, appearing for a little  while, and then disappearing,)
instead of your saying, If the Lord should \so\ will and we  should live, we will also do this or that.
But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is  evil.
To him therefore who knows how to do good, and does it not,  to him it is sin.
