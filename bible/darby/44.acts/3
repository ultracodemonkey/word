And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the  hour of prayer, \which is\ the ninth \hour\;
and a certain man who was lame from his mother`s womb was  being carried, whom they placed every day at the gate of the  temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who were going  into the temple;
who, seeing Peter and John about to enter into the temple,  asked to receive alms.
And Peter, looking stedfastly upon him with John, said, Look  on us.
And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something  from them.
But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have,  this give I to thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean  rise up and walk.
And having taken hold of him \by\ the right hand he raised  him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made  strong.
And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them  into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
And all the people saw him walking and praising God;
and they recognised him, that it was *he* who sat for alms  at the Beautiful gate of the temple; and they were filled with  wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together  to them in the portico which is called Solomon`s, greatly  wondering.
And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, Men of Israel,  why are ye astonished at this? or why do ye gaze on us as if we  had by our own power or piety made him to walk?
The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our  fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom *ye* delivered  up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when *he* had  judged that he should be let go.
But *ye* denied the holy and righteous one, and asked that  a man \that was\ a murderer should be granted to you;
but the originator of life ye slew, whom God raised from  among \the\ dead, whereof *we* are witnesses.
And, by faith in his name, his name has made this \man\  strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him  has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you  all.
And now, brethren, I know that ye did it in ignorance, as  also your rulers;
but God has thus fulfilled what he had announced beforehand  by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should  suffer.
Repent therefore and be converted, for the blotting out of  your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from \the\  presence of the Lord,
and he may send Jesus Christ, who was foreordained for you,
whom heaven indeed must receive till \the\ times of \the\  restoring of all things, of which God has spoken by the mouth  of his holy prophets since time began.
Moses indeed said, A prophet shall \the\ Lord your God  raise up to you out of your brethren like me: him shall ye hear  in everything whatsoever he shall say to you.
And it shall be that whatsoever soul shall not hear that  prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.
And indeed all the prophets from Samuel and those in  succession after \him\, as many as have spoken, have announced  also these days.
*Ye* are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which  God appointed to our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy  seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
To you first God, having raised up his servant, has sent  him, blessing you in turning each one \of you\ from your  wickedness.
