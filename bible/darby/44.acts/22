Brethren and fathers, hear my defence which I now make to  you.
And hearing that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue,  they kept the more quiet; and he says,
*I* am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in  this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to \the\  exactness of the law of \our\ fathers, being zealous for God,  as *ye* are all this day;
who have persecuted this way unto death, binding and  delivering up to prisons both men and women;
as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the  elderhood: from whom also, having received letters to the  brethren, I went to Damascus to bring those also who were  there, bound, to Jerusalem, to be punished.
And it came to pass, as I was journeying and drawing near  to Damascus, that, about mid-day, there suddenly shone out of  heaven a great light round about me.
And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me,  Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
And *I* answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me,  *I* am Jesus the Nazaraean, whom *thou* persecutest.
But they that were with me beheld the light, \and were  filled with fear\, but heard not the voice of him that was  speaking to me.
And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to  me, Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told  thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do.
And as I could not see, through the glory of that light,  being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to  Damascus.
And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law,  borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt \there\,
coming to me and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul,  receive thy sight. And *I*, in the same hour, received my sight  and saw him.
And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee  beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to  hear a voice out of his mouth;
for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what  thou hast seen and heard.
And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and  have thy sins washed away, calling on his name.
And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and  as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy,
and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of  Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning  me.
And *I* said, Lord, they themselves know that *I* was  imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe  on thee;
and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also  myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of  them who killed him.
And he said to me, Go, for *I* will send thee to the  nations afar off.
And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their  voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for  it was not fit he should live.
And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes,  and casting dust into the air,
the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the  fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that  he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him.
But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul  said to the centurion who stood \by\, Is it lawful for you to  scourge a man \who is\ a Roman and uncondemned?
And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it  to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this  man is a Roman.
And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art  *thou* a Roman? And he said, Yes.
And the chiliarch answered, *I*, for a great sum, bought  this citizenship. And Paul said, But *I* was also \free\ born.
Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him  left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained  that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty \of the  matter\ why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and  commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and  having brought Paul down set him before them.
