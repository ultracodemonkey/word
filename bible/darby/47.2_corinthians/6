But \as\ fellow-workmen, we also beseech that ye receive not  the grace of God in vain:
(for he says, I have listened to thee in an accepted time,  and I have helped thee in a day of salvation: behold, now \is  the\ well-accepted time; behold, now \the\ day of salvation:)
giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry  be not blamed;
but in everything commending ourselves as God`s ministers,  in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,
in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings,  in fastings,
in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in  \the\ Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
in \the\ word of truth, in \the\ power of God; through the  arms of righteousness on the right hand and left,
through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good  report: as deceivers, and true;
as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live;  as disciplined, and not put to death;
as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching  many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is  expanded.
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your  affections;
but for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,)  let *your* heart also expand itself.
Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what  participation \is there\ between righteousness and lawlessness?  or what fellowship of light with darkness?
and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part for a  believer along with an unbeliever?
and what agreement of God`s temple with idols? for *ye* are  \the\ living God`s temple; according as God has said, I will  dwell among them, and walk among \them\; and I will be their  God, and they shall be to me a people.
Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be  separated, saith \the\ Lord, and touch not \what is\ unclean,  and *I* will receive you;
and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me  for sons and daughters, saith \the\ Lord Almighty.
