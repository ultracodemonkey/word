This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or  three witnesses shall every matter be established.
I have declared beforehand, and I say beforehand as present  the second time, and now absent, to those that have sinned  before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not  spare.
Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, (who is not  weak towards you, but is powerful among you,
for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he  lives by God`s power; for indeed *we* are weak in him, but we  shall live with him by God`s power towards you,)
examine your own selves if ye be in the faith; prove your  own selves: do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ  is in you, unless indeed ye be reprobates?
Now I hope that ye will know that *we* are not reprobates.
But we pray to God that ye may do nothing evil; not that  *we* may appear approved, but that *ye* may do what is right,  and *we* be as reprobates.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
For we rejoice when *we* may be weak and *ye* may be  powerful. But this also we pray for, your perfecting.
On this account I write these things being absent, that  being present I may not use severity according to the authority  which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for  overthrowing.
For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be  encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love  and peace shall be with you.
Salute one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints salute you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,  and the communion of the Holy Spirit, \be\ with you all.
