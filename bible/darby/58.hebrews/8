Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking \is\,  We have such a one high priest who has sat down on \the\ right  hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens;
minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle,  which the Lord has pitched, \and\ not man.
For every high priest is constituted for the offering both  of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one  also should have something which he may offer.
If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a  priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the  law,
(who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things,  according as Moses was oracularly told \when\ about to make the  tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things  according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the  mountain.)
But now he has got a more excellent ministry, by so much as  he is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on  the footing of better promises.
For if that first was faultless, place had not been sought  for a second.
For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith  the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the  house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda;
not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers  in \the\ day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the  land of Egypt; because *they* did not continue in my covenant,  and *I* did not regard them, saith \the\ Lord.
Because this \is\ the covenant that I will covenant to the  house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my  laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts;  and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for  people.
And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each  his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me  in themselves, from \the\ little one \among them\ unto \the\  great among them.
Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and  their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any  more.
In that he says New, he has made the first old; but that  which grows old and aged \is\ near disappearing.
