And Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fish`s  belly;
and he said: I cried by reason of my distress unto Jehovah,  and he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I: thou  heardest my voice.
For thou didst cast me into the depth, into the heart of the  seas, And the flood was round about me: All thy breakers and  thy billows are gone over me.
And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes, Yet will I  look again toward thy holy temple.
The waters encompassed me, to the soul: The deep was round  about me, The weeds were wrapped about my head.
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The bars of the  earth \closed\ upon me for ever: But thou hast brought up my  life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my  prayer came in unto thee, Into thy holy temple.
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of  thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is  of Jehovah.
And Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited out Jonah  upon the dry \land\.
