Thus saith Jehovah: Where is the bill of your mother`s  divorce, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it  to whom I have sold you? Behold, through your iniquities have  ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother  put away.
Wherefore did I come, and there was no man? I called, and  there was none to answer? Is my hand at all shortened that I  cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my  rebuke I dry up the sea, I make rivers a wilderness; their fish  stink because there is no water, and die for thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth  their covering.
The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the  instructed, that I should know how to succour by a word him  that is weary. He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine  ear to hear as the instructed.
The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear, and I was not  rebellious; I turned not away back.
I gave my back to smiters, and my cheeks to them that  plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and  spitting.
But the Lord Jehovah will help me: therefore shall I not be  confounded; therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I  know that I shall not be ashamed.
He is near that justifieth me: who will contend with me?  let us stand together; who is mine adverse party? let him draw  near unto me.
Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that shall  condemn me? Behold, they all shall grow old as a garment; the  moth shall eat them up.
Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that hearkeneth to  the voice of his servant? he that walketh in darkness, and hath  no light, -- let him confide in the name of Jehovah, and stay  himself upon his God.
Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves  about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and among  the sparks \that\ ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my  hand: ye shall lie down in sorrow.
