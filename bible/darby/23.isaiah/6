In the year of the death of king Uzziah, I saw the Lord  sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled  the temple.
Seraphim were standing above him: each had six wings; with  twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,  and with twain he flew.
And one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is  Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!
And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of  him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
And I said, Woe unto me! for I am undone; for I am a man of  unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean  lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
And one of the seraphim flew unto me, and he had in his hand  a glowing coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the  altar;
and he made it touch my mouth, and said, Behold, this hath  touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin  expiated.
And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send,  and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I; send me.
And he said, Go; and thou shalt say unto this people,  Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing ye  shall see and shall not perceive.
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears  heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and  hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be  converted, and healed.
And I said, Lord, how long? And he said, Until the cities  be wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and  the land become an utter desolation,
and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the solitude be  great in the midst of the land.
But a tenth part shall still be therein, and it shall  return and be eaten; as the terebinth and as the oak whose  trunk \remaineth\ after the felling: the holy seed shall be the  trunk thereof.
