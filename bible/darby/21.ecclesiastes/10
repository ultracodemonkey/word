Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to stink  \and\ ferment; \so\ a little folly is weightier than wisdom  \and\ honour.
The heart of a wise \man\ is at his right hand; but a  fool`s heart at his left.
Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his  sense faileth \him\, and he saith to every one \that\ he is a  fool.
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not  thy place; for quietness pacifieth great offences.
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as an  error \that\ proceedeth from the ruler:
folly is set in great dignities, but the rich sit in a low  place.
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as  servants upon the earth.
He that diggeth a pit falleth into it; and whoso breaketh  down a hedge, a serpent biteth him.
Whoso removeth stones is hurt therewith; he that cleaveth  wood is endangered thereby.
If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then  must he apply more strength; but wisdom is profitable to give  success.
If the serpent bite before enchantment, then the charmer  hath no advantage.
The words of a wise man`s mouth are gracious; but the lips  of a fool swallow up himself.
The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly; and the  end of his talk is mischievous madness.
And the fool multiplieth words: \yet\ man knoweth not what  shall be; and what shall be after him, who will tell him?
The labour of fools wearieth them, because they know not  how to go to the city.
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy  princes eat in the morning!
Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a son of nobles,  and thy princes eat in \due\ season, for strength, and not for  drunkenness!
By much sloth fulness the framework falleth in; and  through idleness of the hands the house drippeth.
A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh life merry;  but money answereth everything.
Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought; and curse not  the rich in thy bedchamber: for the bird of the air will carry  the voice, and that which hath wings will tell the matter.
