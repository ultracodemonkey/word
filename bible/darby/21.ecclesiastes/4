And I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done  under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they  had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors was  power, and they had no comforter.
Then I praised the dead who are already dead more than the  living who are yet alive;
and more fortunate than both is he who hath not yet been,  who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
And I saw all labour, and all success of work, that it is  man`s jealousy of his neighbour. This also is vanity and  pursuit of the wind.
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own  flesh.
Better is a handful with quietness, than both hands full  with labour and pursuit of the wind.
And I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
There is one \alone\ and without a second; also he hath  neither son nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour,  neither is his eye satisfied with riches, and \he saith not\,  For whom then am I labouring, and depriving my soul of good?  This also is vanity and a grievous occupation.
Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for  their labour.
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe  to him that is alone when he falleth, and who hath not another  to lift him up!
Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how  can one alone be warm?
And if a \man\ overpower the one, the two shall withstand  him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish  king, who knoweth no more how to be admonished.
For out of the prison-house he came forth to reign,  although he was born poor in his kingdom.
I saw all the living that walk under the sun, with the  child, the second, that should stand up in his stead.
\There is\ no end of all the people, of all that stood  before them; those however that come after shall not rejoice in  him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after the wind.
