That which was from \the\ beginning, that which we have  heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we  contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of  life;
(and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and  bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was  with the Father, and has been manifested to us:)
that which we have seen and heard we report to you, that  *ye* also may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship \is\  indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And these things write we to you that your joy may be full.
And this is the message which we have heard from him, and  declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at  all.
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in  darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth.
But if we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have  fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his  Son cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the  truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to  forgive us \our\ sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and  his word is not in us.
