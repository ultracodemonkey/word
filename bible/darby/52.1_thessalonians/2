For ye know yourselves, brethren, our entering in which \we  had\ to you, that it has not been in vain;
but, having suffered before and been insulted, even as ye  know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you  the glad tidings of God with much earnest striving.
For our exhortation \was\ not of deceit, nor of uncleanness,  nor in guile;
but even as we have been approved of God to have the glad  tidings entrusted to us, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but  God, who proves our hearts.
For we have not at any time been \among you\ with flattering  discourse, even as ye know, nor with a pretext for  covetousness, God \is\ witness;
nor seeking glory from men, neither from you nor from  others, when we might have been a charge as Christ`s apostles;
but have been gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse would  cherish her own children.
Thus, yearning over you, we had found our delight in having  imparted to you not only the glad tidings of God, but our own  lives also, because ye had become beloved of us.
For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working  night and day, not to be chargeable to any one of you, we have  preached to you the glad tidings of God.
*Ye* \are\ witnesses, and God, how piously and righteously  and blamelessly we have conducted ourselves with you that  believe:
as ye know how, as a father his own children, we used to  exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify,
that ye should walk worthy of God, who calls you to his own  kingdom and glory.
And for this cause we also give thanks to God unceasingly  that, having received \the\ word of \the\ report of God by us,  ye accepted, not men`s word, but, even as it is truly, God`s  word, which also works in you who believe.
For *ye*, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies  of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; for *ye* also have  suffered the same things of your own countrymen as also *they*  of the Jews,
who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and  have driven us out by persecution, and do not please God, and  \are\ against all men,
forbidding us to speak to the nations that they may be  saved, that they may fill up their sins always: but wrath has  come upon them to the uttermost.
But we, brethren, having been bereaved of you and separated  for a little moment in person, not in heart, have used more  abundant diligence to see your face with much desire;
wherefore we have desired to come to you, even I Paul, both  once and twice, and Satan has hindered us.
For what \is\ our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? \are\  not *ye* also before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
for ye are our glory and joy.
