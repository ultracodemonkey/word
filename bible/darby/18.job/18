And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
How long will ye hunt for words? Be intelligent, and then  we will speak.
Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed stupid in  your sight?
Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth  be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its  place?
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the  flame of his fire shall not shine.
The light shall become dark in his tent, and his lamp over  him shall be put out.
The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own  counsel shall cast him down.
For he is sent into the net by his own feet, and he walketh  on the meshes;
The gin taketh \him\ by the heel, the snare layeth hold on  him;
A cord is hidden for him in the ground, and his trap in  the way.
Terrors make him afraid on every side, and chase him at  his footsteps.
His strength is hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready at  his side.
The firstborn of death devoureth the members of his body;  it will devour his members.
His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent, and it  shall lead him away to the king of terrors:
They who are none of his shall dwell in his tent;  brimstone shall be showered upon his habitation:
His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his  branch be cut off;
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall  have no name on the pasture-grounds.
He is driven from light into darkness, and chased out of  the world.
He hath neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any  remaining in the places of his sojourn.
They that come after shall be astonished at his day, as  they that went before \them\ were affrighted.
Surely, such are the dwellings of the unrighteous man, and  such the place of him that knoweth not ùGod.
