And Job answered and said,
I have heard many such things: grievous comforters are ye  all.
Shall words of wind have an end? or what provoketh thee  that thou answerest?
I also could speak as ye: if your soul were in my soul`s  stead, I could join together words against you, and shake my  head at you;
\But\ I would encourage you with my mouth, and the solace  of my lips should assuage \your pain\.
If I speak, my pain is not assuaged; and if I forbear, what  am I eased?
But now he hath made me weary; ... thou hast made desolate  all my family;
Thou hast shrivelled me up! it is become a witness; and my  leanness riseth up against me, it beareth witness to my face.
His anger teareth and pursueth me; he gnasheth with his  teeth against me; \as\ mine adversary he sharpeneth his eyes at  me.
They gape upon me with their mouth; they smite my cheeks  reproachfully; they range themselves together against me.
ùGod hath delivered me over to the iniquitous man, and  hurled me into the hands of the wicked.
I was at rest, but he hath shattered me; he hath taken me  by the neck and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his  mark.
His arrows encompass me round about, he cleaveth my reins  asunder and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the  ground.
He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me  like a mighty man.
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and rolled my horn in  the dust.
My face is red with weeping, and on my eyelids is the  shadow of death;
Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer  is pure.
O earth, cover not my blood, and let there be no place for  my cry!
Even now, behold, my Witness is in the heavens, and he  that voucheth for me is in the heights.
My friends are my mockers; mine eye poureth out tears unto  +God.
Oh that there were arbitration for a man with +God, as a  son of man for his friend!
For years \few\ in number shall pass, -- and I shall go  the way \whence\ I shall not return.
