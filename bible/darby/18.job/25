And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
Dominion and fear are with him; he maketh peace in his high  places.
Is there any number of his troops? and upon whom doth not  his light arise?
And how should man be just with ùGod? Or how should he be  clean that is born of a woman?
Lo, even the moon is not bright; and the stars are not pure  in his sight:
How much less man, a worm, and the son of man, a worm!
