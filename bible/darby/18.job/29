And Job continued his parable and said,
Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when +God  preserved me;
When his lamp shone over my head, \and\ by his light I  walked through darkness;
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret counsel  of +God was over my tent,
When the Almighty was yet with me, my young men round about  me;
When my steps were bathed in milk, and the rock poured out  beside me rivers of oil! ...
When I went out to the gate by the city, when I prepared my  seat on the broadway,
The young men saw me, and hid themselves; and the aged  arose \and\ stood up;
Princes refrained from talking, and laid the hand on their  mouth;
The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue  cleaved to their palate.
When the ear heard \me\, then it blessed me, and when the  eye saw \me\, it gave witness to me;
For I delivered the afflicted that cried, and the  fatherless who had no helper.
The blessing of him that was perishing came upon me, and I  caused the widow`s heart to sing for joy.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was  as a mantle and a turban.
I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame;
I was a father to the needy, and the cause which I knew  not I searched out;
And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the  spoil out of his teeth.
And I said, I shall die in my nest, and multiply my days  as the sand;
My root shall be spread out to the waters, and the dew  will lie all night on my branch;
My glory shall be fresh in me, and my bow be renewed in my  hand.
Unto me they listened, and waited, and kept silence for my  counsel:
After my words they spoke not again, and my speech dropped  upon them;
And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened  their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
\If\ I laughed on them, they believed \it\ not; and they  troubled not the serenity of my countenance.
I chose their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt as a king  in the army, as one that comforteth mourners.
