And Job answered and said,
Even to-day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier  than my groaning.
Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come to  his seat!
I would order the cause before him, and fill my mouth with  arguments;
I would know the words he would answer me, and understand  what he would say unto me.
Would he plead against me with \his\ great power? Nay; but  he would give heed unto me.
There would an upright man reason with him; and I should be  delivered for ever from my judge.
Lo, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I  do not perceive him;
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I behold \him\  not; he hideth himself on the right hand, and I see \him\ not.
But he knoweth the way that I take; he trieth me, I shall  come forth as gold.
My foot hath held to his steps; his way have I kept, and  not turned aside.
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips;  I have laid up the words of his mouth more than the purpose of  my own heart.
But he is in one \mind\, and who can turn him? And what  his soul desireth, that will he do.
For he will perform \what\ is appointed for me; and many  such things are with him.
Therefore am I troubled at his presence; I consider, and I  am afraid of him.
For ùGod hath made my heart soft, and the Almighty  troubleth me;
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither  hath he hidden the gloom from me.
