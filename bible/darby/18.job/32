And these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was  righteous in his own eyes.
Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel,  the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his anger  kindled, because he justified himself rather than God;
and against his three friends was his anger kindled,  because they found no answer, and \yet\ condemned Job.
But Elihu had waited till Job had finished speaking,  because they were older than he.
And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the  three men, and his anger was kindled.
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,  I am young, and ye are aged; wherefore I was timid, and feared  to shew you what I know.
I said, Let days speak, and multitude of years teach  wisdom.
But there is a spirit which is in man; and the breath of  the Almighty giveth them understanding.
It is not the great that are wise; neither do the aged  understand judgment.
Therefore I say, Hearken to me; I also will shew what I  know.
Lo, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your  reasonings, until ye searched out what to say.
Yea, I gave you mine attention, and behold, there was none  of you that confuted Job, that answered his words;
That ye may not say, We have found out wisdom; ùGod will  make him yield, not man.
Now he hath not directed \his\ words against me; and I  will not answer him with your speeches. ...
They were amazed, they answered no more; words failed  them.
And I waited, for they spoke not, but stood still, and  answered no more; --
I will answer, I also in my turn, I also will shew what I  know:
For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth  me.
Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new  flasks, it is ready to burst.
I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips  and answer.
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man`s person; neither  will I give flattery to man.
For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me  away.
