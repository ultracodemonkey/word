And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
If a word were essayed to thee, wouldest thou be grieved?  But who can refrain from speaking?
Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast  strengthened the weak hands;
Thy words have upholden him that was stumbling, and thou  hast braced up the bending knees:
But now it is come upon thee, and thou grievest; it toucheth  thee, and thou art troubled.
Hath not thy piety been thy confidence, and the perfection  of thy ways thy hope?
Remember, I pray thee, who that was innocent has perished?  and where were the upright cut off?
Even as I have seen, they that plough iniquity and sow  mischief, reap the same.
By the breath of +God they perish, and by the blast of his  nostrils are they consumed.
The roar of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and  the teeth of the young lions, are broken;
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of  the lioness are scattered.
Now to me a word was secretly brought, and mine ear  received a whisper thereof.
In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep  falleth on men: --
Fear came on me, and trembling, and made all my bones to  shake;
And a spirit passed before my face -- the hair of my flesh  stood up --
It stood still; I could not discern the appearance thereof:  a form was before mine eyes; I heard a slight murmur and a  voice:
Shall \mortal\ man be more just than +God? Shall a man be  purer than his Maker?
Lo, he trusteth not his servants, and his angels he  chargeth with folly:
How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose  foundation is in the dust, who are crushed as the moth!
From morning to evening are they smitten: without any  heeding it, they perish for ever.
Is not their tent-cord torn away in them? they die, and  without wisdom.
