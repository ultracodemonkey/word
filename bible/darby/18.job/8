And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
How long wilt thou speak these things? and the words of thy  mouth be a strong wind?
Doth ùGod pervert judgment, and the Almighty pervert  justice?
If thy children have sinned against him, he hath also given  them over into the hand of their transgression.
If thou seek earnestly unto ùGod, and make thy supplication  to the Almighty,
If thou be pure and upright, surely now he will awake for  thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous;
And though thy beginning was small, yet thine end shall be  very great.
For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, and  attend to the researches of their fathers;
For we are \but\ of yesterday, and know nothing, for our  days upon earth are a shadow.
Shall not they teach thee, \and\ tell thee, and utter words  out of their heart?
Doth the papyrus shoot up without mire? doth the reed-grass  grow without water?
Whilst it is yet in its greenness \and\ not cut down, it  withereth before any \other\ grass.
So are the paths of all that forget ùGod; and the profane  man`s hope shall perish,
Whose confidence shall be cut off, and his reliance is a  spider`s web.
He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand; he  shall lay hold on it, but it shall not endure.
He is full of sap before the sun, and his sprout shooteth  forth over his garden;
His roots are entwined about the stoneheap; he seeth the  place of stones.
If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him: I  have not seen thee!
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the dust  shall others grow.
Behold, ùGod will not cast off a perfect man, neither will  he take evil-doers by the hand.
Whilst he would fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips  with shouting,
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame, and the  tent of the wicked be no more.
