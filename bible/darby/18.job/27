And Job continued his parable and said,
\As\ ùGod liveth, who hath taken away my right, and the  Almighty, who hath embittered my soul,
All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of +God is  in my nostrils,
My lips shall not speak unrighteousness, nor my tongue  utter deceit!
Be it far from me that I should justify you; till I die I  will not remove my blamelessness from me.
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my  heart reproacheth \me\ not one of my days.
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up  against me as the unrighteous.
For what is the hope of the ungodly, when \God\ cutteth him  off, when +God taketh away his soul?
Will ùGod hear his cry when distress cometh upon him?
Doth he delight himself in the Almighty? will he at all  times call upon +God?
I will teach you concerning the hand of ùGod; what is with  the Almighty will I not conceal.
Behold, ye yourselves have all seen \it\; and why are ye  thus altogether vain?
This is the portion of the wicked man with ùGod, and the  heritage of the violent, which they receive from the Almighty:  --
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword, and  his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread;
Those that remain of him shall be buried by death, and his  widows shall not weep.
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing  as the clay;
He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on; and the  innocent shall divide the silver.
He buildeth his house as the moth, and as a booth that a  keeper maketh.
He lieth down rich, but will do so no more; he openeth his  eyes, and he is not.
Terrors overtake him like waters; a whirlwind stealeth him  away in the night.
The east wind carrieth him away and he is gone; and as a  storm it hurleth him out of his place.
And \God\ shall cast upon him and not spare: he would fain  flee out of his hand.
\Men\ shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him  out of his place.
