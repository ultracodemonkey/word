And Job answered and said,
How hast thou helped the powerless; how saved the arm that  is without strength!
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, and  abundantly declared the thing as it is!
For whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came  from thee?
The shades tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants  thereof;
Sheol is naked before him, and destruction hath no  covering.
He stretcheth out the north over empty space, he hangeth  the earth upon nothing;
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud  is not rent under them.
He covereth the face of his throne, he spreadeth his cloud  upon it.
He hath traced a fixed circle over the waters, unto the  confines of light and darkness.
The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at  his rebuke.
He stirreth up the sea by his power, and by his  understanding he smiteth through Rahab.
By his Spirit the heavens are adorned; his hand hath  formed the fleeing serpent.
Lo, these are the borders of his ways; but what a whisper  of a word do we hear of him! And the thunder of his power, who  can understand?
