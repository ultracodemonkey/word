And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a  man of much talk be justified?
Should thy fictions make men hold their peace? and  shouldest thou mock, and no one make \thee\ ashamed?
For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in  thine eyes.
But oh that +God would speak, and open his lips against  thee;
And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, how that  they are the double of what is realised; and know that +God  passeth by \much\ of thine iniquity!
Canst thou by searching find out +God? canst thou find out  the Almighty to perfection?
\It is as\ the heights of heaven; what wilt thou do? deeper  than Sheol; what canst thou know?
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader  than the sea.
If he pass by, and shut up, and call to judgment, who can  hinder him?
For he knoweth vain men, and seeth wickedness when \man\  doth not consider it;
Yet a senseless man will make bold, though man be born  \like\ the foal of a wild ass.
If thou prepare thy heart and stretch out thy hands toward  him,
If thou put far away the iniquity which is in thy hand,  and let not wrong dwell in thy tents;
Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot, and  thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear:
For thou shalt forget misery; as waters that are passed  away shalt thou remember it;
And life shall arise brighter than noonday; though thou be  enshrouded in darkness, thou shalt be as the morning,
And thou shalt have confidence, because there shall be  hope; and having searched about \thee\, thou shalt take rest in  safety.
Yea, thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;  and many shall seek thy favour.
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and \all\ refuge  shall vanish from them, and their hope \shall be\ the breathing  out of life.
