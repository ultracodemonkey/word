Hath not man a life of labour upon earth? and are not his  days like the days of a hireling?
As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow, and a hireling  expecteth his wages,
So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome  nights are appointed to me.
If I lie down, I say, When shall I rise up, and the darkness  be gone? and I am full of tossings until the dawn.
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is  broken, and suppurates.
My days are swifter than a weaver`s shuttle, and are spent  without hope.
Remember thou that my life is wind; mine eye shall no more  see good.
The eye of him that hath seen me shall behold me no \more\:  thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
The cloud consumeth and vanisheth away; so he that goeth  down to Sheol shall not come up.
He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his  place know him again.
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the  anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my  soul.
Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch  over me?
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my  complaint;
Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through  visions;
So that my soul chooseth strangling, death, rather than my  bones.
I loathe it; I shall not live always: let me alone, for my  days are a breath.
What is man, that thou makest much of him? and that thou  settest thy heart upon him?
And that thou visitest him every morning, triest him every  moment?
How long wilt thou not look away from me, nor let me alone  till I swallow down my spittle?
Have I sinned, what do I unto thee, thou Observer of men?  Why hast thou set me as an object of assault for thee, so that  I am become a burden to myself?
And why dost not thou forgive my transgression and take  away mine iniquity? for now shall I lie down in the dust, and  thou shalt seek me early, and I shall not be.
