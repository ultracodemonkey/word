And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred silver-pieces  that were taken from thee, and about which thou didst curse and  speak of in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took  it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah!
And he restored the eleven hundred silver-pieces to his  mother; and his mother said, I had dedicated the silver to  Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a  molten image; and now I will restore it to thee.
Now he restored the silver to his mother; and his mother  took two hundred silver-pieces and gave them to the founder,  and he made of them a graven image and a molten image; and they  were in the house of Micah.
And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod  and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his  priest.
In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did  what was right in his own eyes.
And there was a young man out of Bethlehem-Judah of the  family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
And the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem-Judah,  to sojourn where he might find \a place\. And as he journeyed,  he came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah.
And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to  him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem-Judah, and I go to sojourn  where I may find \a place\.
And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a  father and a priest, and I will give thee yearly ten  silver-pieces, and a suit of garments, and thy victuals. And  the Levite went in.
And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the  young man was to him as one of his sons.
And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became  his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Then said Micah, Now I know that Jehovah will do me good,  because I have the Levite for priest.
