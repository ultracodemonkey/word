And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that  the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah on the fourth \day\ of  the ninth month, \even\ in Chislev,
when Bethel had sent Sherezer and Regem-melech, and his men,  to supplicate Jehovah,
\and\ to speak unto the priests that were in the house of  Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in  the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done now so many  years?
And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,
Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,  saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the  seventh \month\, even those seventy years, did ye really fast  unto me, \even\ unto me?
And when ye ate, and when ye drank, was it not you that were  eating and drinking?
Are not these the words that Jehovah cried by the former  prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and at peace, and her  cities round about her, when the south and the lowland were  inhabited?
And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying,
Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Execute true  judgment, and shew loving-kindness and mercies one to another,
and oppress not the widow and the fatherless, the stranger  and the afflicted; and let none of you imagine evil against his  brother in your heart.
But they refused to hearken, and turned a rebellious  shoulder, and made their ears heavy, that they should not hear.
And they made their heart \as\ an adamant, that they should  not hear the law, and the words that Jehovah of hosts sent by  his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets: therefore was  there great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.
And it came to pass, like as he called, and they would not  hear, so they called, and I would not hear, saith Jehovah of  hosts;
and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations  whom they knew not, and the land was desolate after them, so  that no one passed through nor returned; and they laid the  pleasant land desolate.
