And I lifted up mine eyes again, and saw, and behold, a  flying roll.
And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I see a  flying roll: the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the  breadth thereof ten cubits.
And he said unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over  the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall  be cut off according to it on this side; and every one that  sweareth shall be cut off according to it on that side.
I will cause it to go forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, and it  shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of  him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall lodge in the  midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber  thereof and the stones thereof.
And the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto  me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth  forth.
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that  goeth forth. And he said, This is their resemblance in all the  land.
And behold, there was lifted up a round plate of lead; and  this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her into the  midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the  mouth thereof.
And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, there came  out two women, and the wind was in their wings; and they had  wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah  between the earth and the heavens.
And I said to the angel that talked with me, Whither do  these carry the ephah?
And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of  Shinar; and it shall be established, and set there upon its own  base.
