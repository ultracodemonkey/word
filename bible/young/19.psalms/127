A Song of the Ascents, by Solomon. <BR>If Jehovah doth not build the house, In vain have its builders laboured at it, If Jehovah doth not watch a city, In vain hath a watchman waked.
Vain for you who are rising early, Who delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, So He giveth to His beloved one sleep.
Lo, an inheritance of Jehovah \are\ sons, A reward \is\ the fruit of the womb.
As arrows in the hand of a mighty one, So \are\ the sons of the young men.
O the happiness of the man Who hath filled his quiver with them, They are not ashamed, For they speak with enemies in the gate!
