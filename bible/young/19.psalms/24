A Psalm of David. <BR>To Jehovah \is\ the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.
For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.
Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?
The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.
He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.
This \is\ a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.
Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!
Who \is\ this -- `the king of glory?` Jehovah -- strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.
Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!
Who \is\ He -- this `king of glory?` Jehovah of hosts -- He \is\ the king of glory! Selah.
