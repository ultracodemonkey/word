Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.
Jehovah in Zion \is\ great, And high He \is\ over all the peoples.
They praise Thy name, `Great, and fearful, holy \it\ is.`
And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou -- Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou -- Thou hast done.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy \is\ He.
Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.
In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.
O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy \is\ Jehovah our God!
