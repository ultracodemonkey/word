A Song of the Ascents, by David. <BR>Lo, how good and how pleasant The dwelling of brethren -- even together!
As the good oil on the head, Coming down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, That cometh down on the skirt of his robes,
As dew of Hermon -- That cometh down on hills of Zion, For there Jehovah commanded the blessing -- Life unto the age!
