To the Overseer, on the octave. -- A Psalm of David. 
Save, Jehovah, for the saintly hath failed, For the stedfast have ceased From the sons of men:
Vanity they speak each with his neighbour, Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.
Jehovah doth cut off all lips of flattery, A tongue speaking great things,
Who said, `By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips \are\ our own; who \is\ lord over us?`
Because of the spoiling of the poor, Because of the groaning of the needy, Now do I arise, saith Jehovah, I set in safety \him who\ doth breathe for it.
Sayings of Jehovah \are\ pure sayings; Silver tried in a furnace of earth refined sevenfold.
Thou, O Jehovah, dost preserve them, Thou keepest us from this generation to the age.
Around the wicked walk continually, According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!
