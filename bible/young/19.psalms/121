A Song of the Ascents. <BR>I lift up mine eyes unto the hills, Whence doth my help come?
My help \is\ from Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,
He suffereth not thy foot to be moved, Thy preserver slumbereth not.
Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He who is preserving Israel.
Jehovah \is\ thy preserver, Jehovah \is\ thy shade on thy right hand,
By day the sun doth not smite thee, Nor the moon by night.
Jehovah preserveth thee from all evil, He doth preserve thy soul.
Jehovah preserveth thy going out and thy coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!
