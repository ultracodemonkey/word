By David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.
Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified \are\ my reins and my heart.
For Thy kindness \is\ before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Thy truth.
I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.
I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.
I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.
To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Thy wonders.
Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.
Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,
In whose hand \is\ a wicked device, And their right hand \is\ full of bribes.
And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.
My foot hath stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Jehovah!
