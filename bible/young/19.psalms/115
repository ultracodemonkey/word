Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, But to Thy name give honour, For Thy kindness, for Thy truth.
Why do the nations say, `Where, pray, \is\ their God.
And our God \is\ in the heavens, All that He hath pleased He hath done.
Their idols \are\ silver and gold, work of man`s hands,
A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
Ears they have, and they hear not, A nose they have, and they smell not,
Their hands, but they handle not, Their feet, and they walk not;
Nor do they mutter through their throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
O Israel, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield \is\ He.`
O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield \is\ He.`
Ye fearing Jehovah, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield \is\ He.`
Jehovah hath remembered us, He blesseth, He blesseth the house of Israel, He blesseth the house of Aaron,
He blesseth those fearing Jehovah, The small with the great.
Jehovah addeth to you, to you, and to your sons.
Blessed \are\ ye of Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,
The heavens -- the heavens \are\ Jehovah`s, And the earth He hath given to sons of men,
The dead praise not Jah, Nor any going down to silence.
And we, we bless Jah, From henceforth, and unto the age. Praise ye Jah!
