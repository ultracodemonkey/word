A Song of the Ascents. <BR>Unto Thee I have lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens.
Lo, as eyes of men-servants \Are\ unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maid-servant \Are\ unto the hand of her mistress, So \are\ our eyes unto Jehovah our God, Till that He doth favour us.
Favour us, O Jehovah, favour us, For greatly have we been filled with contempt,
Greatly hath our soul been filled With the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!
