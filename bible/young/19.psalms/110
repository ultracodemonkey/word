A Psalm of David. <BR>The affirmation of Jehovah to my Lord: `Sit at My right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.`
The rod of thy strength doth Jehovah send from Zion, Rule in the midst of thine enemies.
Thy people \are\ free-will gifts in the day of Thy strength, in the honours of holiness, From the womb, from the morning, Thou hast the dew of thy youth.
Jehovah hath sworn, and doth not repent, `Thou \art\ a priest to the age, According to the order of Melchizedek.`
The Lord on thy right hand smote kings In the day of His anger.
He doth judge among the nations, He hath completed the carcases, Hath smitten the head over the mighty earth.
From a brook in the way he drinketh, Therefore he doth lift up the head!
