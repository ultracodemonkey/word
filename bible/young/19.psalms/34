By David, in his changing his behaviour before Abimelech, and he driveth him away, and he goeth. 
I do bless Jehovah at all times, Continually His praise \is\ in my mouth.
In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself, Hear do the humble and rejoice.
Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me, And we exalt His name together.
I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, And from all my fears did deliver me.
They looked expectingly unto Him, And they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.
This poor \one\ called, and Jehovah heard, And from all his distresses saved him.
A messenger of Jehovah is encamping, Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.
Taste ye and see that Jehovah \is\ good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him.
Fear Jehovah, ye His holy ones, For there is no lack to those fearing Him.
Young lions have lacked and been hungry, And those seeking Jehovah lack not any good,
Come ye, children, hearken to me, The fear of Jehovah I do teach you.
Who \is\ the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?
Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking deceit.
Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah \are\ unto the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.
(The face of Jehovah \is\ on doers of evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.)
They cried, and Jehovah heard, And from all their distresses delivered them.
Near \is\ Jehovah to the broken of heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth.
Many \are\ the evils of the righteous, Out of them all doth Jehovah deliver him.
He is keeping all his bones, One of them hath not been broken.
Evil doth put to death the wicked, And those hating the righteous are desolate.
Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!
