A Psalm of Thanksgiving. <BR>Shout to Jehovah, all the earth.
Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him with singing.
Know that Jehovah He \is\ God, He made us, and we are His, His people -- and the flock of His pasture.
Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.
For good \is\ Jehovah, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!
