By David. <BR>Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And all my inward parts -- His Holy Name.
Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And forget not all His benefits,
Who is forgiving all thine iniquities, Who is healing all thy diseases,
Who is redeeming from destruction thy life, Who is crowning thee -- kindness and mercies,
Who is satisfying with good thy desire, Renew itself as an eagle doth thy youth.
Jehovah is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed.
He maketh known His ways to Moses, To the sons of Israel His acts.
Merciful and gracious \is\ Jehovah, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.
Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the age doth He watch.
Not according to our sins hath He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us.
For, as the height of the heavens \is\ above the earth, His kindness hath been mighty over those fearing Him.
As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions.
As a father hath mercy on sons, Jehovah hath mercy on those fearing Him.
For He hath known our frame, Remembering that we \are\ dust.
Mortal man! as grass \are\ his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;
For a wind hath passed over it, and it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more.
And the kindness of Jehovah \Is\ from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons` sons,
To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them.
Jehovah in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled.
Bless Jehovah, ye His messengers, Mighty in power -- doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.
Bless Jehovah, all ye His hosts, His ministers -- doing His pleasure.
Bless Jehovah, all ye His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah!
