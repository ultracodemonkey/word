A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.
Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.
The voice of Jehovah \is\ on the waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Jehovah \is\ on many waters.
The voice of Jehovah \is\ with power, The voice of Jehovah \is\ with majesty,
The voice of Jehovah \is\ shivering cedars, Yea, Jehovah shivers the cedars of Lebanon.
And He causeth them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,
The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery flames,
The voice of Jehovah paineth a wilderness, Jehovah paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks, And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith, `Glory.`
Jehovah on the deluge hath sat, And Jehovah sitteth king -- to the age,
Jehovah strength to his people giveth, Jehovah blesseth His people with peace!
