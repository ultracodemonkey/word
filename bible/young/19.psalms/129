A Song of the Ascents. <BR>Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:
Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.
Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.
Jehovah \is\ righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked.
Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.
They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,
That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.
And the passers by have not said, `The blessing of Jehovah \is\ on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!`
