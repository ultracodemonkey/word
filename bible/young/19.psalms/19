To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. 
The heavens \are\ recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The expanse \is\ declaring.
Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth knowledge.
There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice hath not been heard.
Into all the earth hath their line gone forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in them,
And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.
From the end of the heavens \is\ his going out, And his revolution \is\ unto their ends, And nothing is hid from his heat.
The law of Jehovah \is\ perfect, refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Jehovah \are\ stedfast, Making wise the simple,
The precepts of Jehovah \are\ upright, Rejoicing the heart, The command of Jehovah \is\ pure, enlightening the eyes,
The fear of Jehovah \is\ clean, standing to the age, The judgments of Jehovah \are\ true, They have been righteous -- together.
They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.
Also -- Thy servant is warned by them, `In keeping them \is\ a great reward.`
Errors! who doth understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent,
Also -- from presumptuous ones keep back Thy servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And declared innocent of much transgression,
Let the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer!
