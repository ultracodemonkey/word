A Song of the Ascents. <BR>From depths I have called Thee, Jehovah.
Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?
But with Thee \is\ forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared.
I hoped \for\ Jehovah -- hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited.
My soul \is\ for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!
Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with Jehovah \is\ kindness, And abundant with Him \is\ redemption.
And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
