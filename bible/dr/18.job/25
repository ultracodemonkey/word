Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and I said:
Power and terror are with him, who maketh peace in his high places.
Is there any numbering of his soldiers? and upon whom shall not his light arise?
Can man be justified compared with God, or he that is born of a woman appear clean?
Behold even the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not pure in his sight.
How much less man that is rottenness and the son of man who is a worm?
