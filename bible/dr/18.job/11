Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:
Shall not he that speaketh much, hear also? or shall a man full of talk be justified?
Shall men hold their peace to thee only? and when thou hast mocked others, shall no man confute thee?
For thou hast said: My word is pure, and I am clean in thy sight.
And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,
That he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold, and thou mightest understand that he exacteth much less of thee, than thy iniquity deserveth.
Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?
He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do ? he is deeper than hell, and how wilt thou know?
The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
If he shall overturn all things, or shall press them together, who shall contradict him?
For he knoweth the vanity of men, and when he seeth iniquity, doth he not consider it?
A vain man is lifted up into pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild ass's colt.
Rut thou hast hardened thy heart, and hast spread thy hands to him.
If thou wilt put away from thee the iniquity that is in thy hand, and lot not injustice remain in thy tabernacle:
Then mayst thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear.
Thou shalt also forget misery, and remember it only as waters that are passed away.
And brightness like that of the noonday, shall arise to thee at evening: and when thou shalt think thyself consumed, thou shalt rise as the day star.
And thou shalt have confidence, hope being set before thee, and being buried thou shalt sleep secure.
Thou shalt rest, and there shall be none to make thee afraid: and many shall entreat thy face.
But the eyes of the wicked shall decay, and the way to escape shall fail them, and their hope the abomination of the soul.
