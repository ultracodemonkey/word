Unto the end, in hymns, for David.
Hear, O God, my supplication: be attentive to my prayer,
To thee have I cried from the ends of the earth: when my heart was in anguish, thou hast exalted me on a rock. Thou hast conducted me;
for thou hast been my hope; a tower of strength against the face of the enemy.
In thy tabernacle I shall dwell for ever: I shall be protected under the covert of thy wings.
For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer: thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name.
Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: his years even to generation and generation.
He abideth for ever in the sight of God: his mercy and truth who shall search ?
So will I sing a psalm to thy name for ever and ever: that I may pay my vows from day to day.
