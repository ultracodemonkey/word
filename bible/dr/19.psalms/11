Unto the end. A psalm for David.<BR>In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow?
For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow; they have prepared their arrows in the quiver; to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.
For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done?
The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men.
The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.
He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup.
For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness.
