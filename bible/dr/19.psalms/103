For David himself. <BR>Bless the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is within me bless his holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for thee.
Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's.
The Lord doth mercies, and judgment for all that suffer wrong.
He hath made his ways known to Moses: his wills to the children of Israel.
The ford is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.
He will not always be angry: nor will he threaten for ever.
He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.
As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him:
for he knoweth our frame. He remembereth that we are dust:
man's days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he flourish.
For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: and he shall know his place no more.
But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity and unto eternity upon them that fear him: And his justice unto children's children,
to such as keep his covenant, And are mindful of his commandments to do them.
The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: and his kingdom shall rule over all.
Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: you that are mighty in strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.
Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: you ministers of his that do his will.
Bless the Lord, all his works: in every place of his dominion, O my soul, bless thou the Lord.
