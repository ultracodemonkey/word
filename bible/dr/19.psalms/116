I have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer.
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me: and in my days I will call upon him.
The sorrows of death have encompassed me: and the perils of hell have found me. I met with trouble and sorrow:
and I called upon the name of the Lord. O Lord, deliver my soul.
The Lord is merciful and just, and our God sheweth mercy.
The Lord is the keeper of little ones: I was little and he delivered me.
Turn, O my soul, into thy rest: for the Lord hath been bountiful to thee.
For he hath delivered my soul from death: my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
I will please the Lord in the land of the living.
I have believed, therefore have I spoken; but I have been humbled exceedingly.
I said in my excess: Every man is a liar.
What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me?
I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people:
precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
O Lord, for I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds:
I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people:
in the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
