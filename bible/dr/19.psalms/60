Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the inscription of a title, to David himself, for doctrine, when he set fire to Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal and Joab returned and slew of Edom, in the vale of the saltpits, twelve thousand men.
O God, thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; thou hast been angry, and hast had mercy on us.
Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it: heal thou the breaches thereof, for it has been moved.
Thou hast shewn thy people hard things; thou hast made us drink wine of sorrow.
Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee: that they may flee from before the bow: That thy beloved may be delivered.
Save me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem; and will mete out the vale of tabernacles.
Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim is the strength of my head. Juda is my king:
Moab is the pot of my hope. Into Edom will I stretch out my shoe: to me the foreigners are made subject.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go out with our armies?
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the salvation of man.
Through God we shall do mightily: and he shall bring to nothing them that afflict us.
