A psalm for David himself. The Lord hath reigned, let the people be angry: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved.
The Lord is great in Sion, and high above all people.
Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy:
and the king's honour loveth judgment. Thou hast prepared directions: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, for it is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests: and Samuel among them that call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:
he spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them.
Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to them, and taking vengeance on all their inventions.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the Lord our God is holy.
