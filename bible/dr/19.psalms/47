Unto the end, for the sons of Core.
O clap your hands, all ye nations: shout unto God with the voice of Joy,
For the Lord is high, terrible: a great king over all the earth.
He hath subdued the people under us; and the nations under our feet.
He hath chosen for us his inheritance the beauty of Jacob which he hath loved.
God is ascended with jubilee, and the Lord with the sound of trumpet.
Sing praises to our God, sing ye: sing praises to our king, sing ye.
For God is the king of all the earth: sing ye wisely.
God shall reign over the nations: God sitteth on his holy throne.
The princes of the people are gathered together, with the God of Abraham: for the strong gods of the earth are exceedingly exalted.
