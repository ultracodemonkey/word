The elder to the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
Who have borne testimony of thy charity before the church: whom if thou shalt bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou wilt do well:
Because for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth.
I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not.
Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content with that, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.
Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
Demetrius hath good report by all men, and by the truth itself: and we also bear testimony; and ye know that our testimony is true.
I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to thee:
But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.\
