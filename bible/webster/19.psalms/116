I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
Because he hath inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
The sorrows of death encompassed me, and the pains of hell came upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful.
The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
Return to thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits towards me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.
I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people,
In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
