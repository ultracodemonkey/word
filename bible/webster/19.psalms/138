A Psalm of David. <BR>I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise to thee.
I will worship towards thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
In the day when I cried thou didst answer me, and strengthen me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.
Though the LORD is high, yet hath he respect to the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand will save me.
The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works thy own hands.
