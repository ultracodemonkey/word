A Song of degrees. <BR>Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thy house: thy children like olive plants around thy table.
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Yes, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
