To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth. 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth shall be removed, and though the mountains shall be carried into the midst of the sea;
Though its waters shall roar and be disturbed, though the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah.
There is a river, the streams of which shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
He maketh wars to cease to the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear asunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
