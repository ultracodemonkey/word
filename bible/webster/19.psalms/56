To the chief Musician upon Jonathelem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. 
Be merciful to me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
My enemies would daily swallow me up: for they are many that fight against me, O thou Most High.
In the time when I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.
Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They assemble themselves, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity; in thy anger cast down the people, O God.
Thou numberest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
When I cry to thee, then shall my enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.
In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.
In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do to me.
Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises to thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt thou not deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
