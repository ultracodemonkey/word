Michtam of David. <BR>Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said to the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;
But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names into my lips.
The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; yes, I have a goodly heritage.
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night season.
I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.
