The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, with which he hath girded himself: the world also is established, that it cannot be moved.
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift their waves.
The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty waves of the sea.
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thy house, O LORD, for ever.
