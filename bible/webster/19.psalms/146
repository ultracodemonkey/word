Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises to my God while I have any being.
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:
Who made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that is in them: who keepeth truth for ever:
Who executeth judgment for the oppressed: who giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:
The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
The LORD will reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
