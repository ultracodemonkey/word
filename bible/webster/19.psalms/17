A Prayer of David. <BR>Hear the right, O LORD, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thy eyes behold the things that are equal.
Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
Uphold my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thy ear to me, and hear my speech.
Show thy wonderful loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them who put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shade of thy wings.
From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who encompass me,
They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O LORD disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, who is thy sword:
From men who are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, who have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
