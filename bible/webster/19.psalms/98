A Psalm. <BR>O sing to the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shown in the sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth towards the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
Sing to the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it, the world, and they that dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness will he judge the world, and the people with equity.
