A Song of degrees. <BR>LORD, remember David and all his afflictions;
How he swore to the LORD, and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob;
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,
Until I find a place for the LORD, a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thy anointed.
The LORD hath sworn in truth to David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them; their children also shall sit upon thy throne for ever.
For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.
This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I make the horn of David to bud, I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
