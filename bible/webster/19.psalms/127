A Song of degrees for Solomon. <BR>Except the LORD shall build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the LORD shall keep the city, the watchman waketh in vain.
It is vain for you to rise early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children are a heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man: so are children of the youth.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
