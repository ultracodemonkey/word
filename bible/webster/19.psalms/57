To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. 
Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yes, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities are overpast.
I will cry to God most high; to God that performeth all things for me.
He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst of which they have fallen themselves. Selah.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing to thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is great to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.
