A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. 
O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
For thy arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand falleth heavy upon me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities have gone over my head: as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
My wounds are offensive, and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
For my loins are filled with a lothsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am feeble and grievously broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of my eyes, that also is gone from me.
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my affliction; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
For I will declare my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
But my enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
They also that render evil for good are my adversaries; because I follow the thing that is good.
Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
