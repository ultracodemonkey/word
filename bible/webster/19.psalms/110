A Psalm of David. <BR>The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.
The LORD will send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.
Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness: from the womb of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth.
The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek.
The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
He will judge among the heathen, he will fill the places with the dead bodies; he will wound the heads over many countries.
He will drink of the brook in the way: therefore will he lift up the head.
