A Psalm of David. <BR>Give to the LORD, O ye mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.
Give to the LORD, the glory due to his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yes, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and maketh bare the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yes, the LORD sitteth king for ever.
The LORD will give strength to his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
