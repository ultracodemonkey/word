The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he setteth between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all people.
Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
Thou didst answer them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
