A Psalm of David, Maschil. <BR>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man to whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
When I kept silence, my bones became old through my roaring all the day long.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drouth of summer. Selah.
I acknowledged my sin to thee, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this shall every one that is godly pray to thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh to him.
Thou art my hiding place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with my eye.
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near to thee.
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall encompass him.
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
