O sing to the LORD a new song: sing to the LORD, all the earth.
Sing to the LORD, bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to day.
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
Give to the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength.
Give to the LORD the glory due to his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he will judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness of it.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD:
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
