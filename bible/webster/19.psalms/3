A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. 
LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many are they that rise up against me.
Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me from his holy hill. Selah.
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me on all sides.
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth to the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
