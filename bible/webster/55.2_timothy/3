This know also, that in the last days perilous times will come.
For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
Having a form of godliness, but denying its power: from such turn away.
For of this sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts;
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
But they shall proceed no further: for their folly will be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,
Persecutions, afflictions which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.
And all indeed that will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
But evil men and seducers will become worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing from whom thou hast learned them;
And that from a child thou hast known the sacred scriptures, which are able to make thee wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.
