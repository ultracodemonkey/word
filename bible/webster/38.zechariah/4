And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
And said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick: all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which were upon the top of it.
And two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side.
So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these are? and I said, No, my lord.
Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.
Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth its head-stone with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace, to it.
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you.
For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
Then I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon its left side?
And I answered again, and said to him, What are these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
