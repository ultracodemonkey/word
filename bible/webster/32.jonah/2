Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
And said, I cried by reason of my affliction to the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardst my voice.
For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods encompassed me: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again towards thy holy temple.
The waters encompassed me, even to the soul: the depth inclosed me on every side, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came to thee, into thy holy temple.
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.
And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
