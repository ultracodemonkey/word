I exhort then, first of all, that  supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men;
including kings and all who are in high station, in order that we may live peaceful and tranquil lives with all godliness and  gravity.
This is right, and is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,
who is willing for  all mankind to be saved and come to a full knowledge of the truth.
For there is but one God and but one Mediator between God and men--Christ Jesus,  Himself man;
who gave Himself as the redemption price for all--a fact testified to at its own appointed time,
and of which I have been appointed a herald and an Apostle (I am speaking the truth: it is not a fiction), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
So then I would have  the men  everywhere pray, lifting to God holy hands which are  unstained with anger or strife;
and I would have the women dress becomingly, with modesty and self-control, not with plaited hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,
but--as befits women making a claim to godliness--with the ornament of good works.
A woman should quietly learn from others with entire submissiveness.
I do not permit  a woman to teach, nor have authority over  a man, but she must remain silent.
For Adam was formed first, and then Eve;
and Adam was not deceived, but his wife was thoroughly deceived, and so  became involved in transgression.
Yet a woman will be  brought safely through childbirth if  she and her husband continue to live in faith and love and growing holiness, with habitual self-restraint.
